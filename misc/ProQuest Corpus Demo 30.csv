In a three-step process, the starting point is to focus on where the benefits lie, according to Madden, and get onboard the people in the organisation who understand the value in what you're doing.",1448054010,"Analytics specialists recommend starting with a project that will deliver the most tangible benefits to the business. Ian Campbell reports.To successfully deploy analytics and BI solutions organisations must first identify the outcomes that will deliver a return on the investment, the insights that will provide the most tangible benefits to the business. Like any IT project, the planning stage is crucial. The more you can align a project to goals and milestones, the more likely it will succeed.Gearoid Madden, insurance lead in Accenture's Dublin Analytics Centre, recommends a step-by-step approach. ""It's hard for some organisations to understand where the value is in so we recommend an iterative process that allows clients to move from being an immature analytics organisation to one where analytics is key to their competitiveness,"" he said.In a three-step process, the starting point is to focus on where the benefits lie, according to Madden, and get onboard the people in the organisation who understand the value in what you're doing. The second step is to prove the business case by demonstrating the power of analytics in one corner of the business. Then you can plot a roadmap to the third stage, the industrialisation of the project, rolling analytics out to the wider business and making it sustainable.Madden describes it as an end-to-end process, recommending clients start by bringing the analytics to the data to achieve specific business outcomes. Another strategy is to build the analytics platform first, try out the capability and then go looking for the business insights you want to mine. ""It's industrialisation first, like a traditional data warehouse where you start by bringing all the information together,"" he said.Accenture usually recommends the first strategy, targeting a particular area for analytics. ""The business problems are the same; what's changed is the explosion of data and the technologies and capabilities available to gather data and drive insights,"" he said.Aside from telecommunication companies and multinationals, few companies in Ireland need concern themselves with the Big Data phenomenon, according to John Coleman, managing director of ProStrategy Coleman. He said existing tools are more than adequate for what most businesses have to deal with.""Traditional capabilities around data warehousing and BI can handle the volume of data that most Irish organisations are working with. So the same fundamentals still apply about how you take data and present it to users in a way that they can get value from it,"" he said.The challenge is bringing through the information that's going to deliver the most business benefits, resisting the temptation to try and do too much, too soon. Ironically, the types of tools that ProStrategy deploys make it too easy to overextend a project. ""A lot of BI projects suffer from scope creep' and it can be difficult to see what's relevant and what's not,"" he warned.The company will typically implement IBM's Cognos or Microsoft's BI stack. Which one will depend on where the client is at in terms of existing systems and what they are trying to achieve.""A lot of firms have technical skills in Microsoft and may already have some of the components, so it becomes the obvious choice. Others might be more focused on giving business users self-service BI without too much involvement from their IT people - that would push them towards Cognos,"" said Colman.He said that Cognos was better in terms of business planning capabilities; that it uses in-memory cubing and pushes the boundaries about what can be done with high volumes of data. ""You can bring in 50 million rows of historical data and start running different forecasting scenarios in seconds. A few years ago that capability wasn't there - you could pull data into Excel and do a bit of work with it but nothing like what you can do now with in-memory,"" he said.The game changer is what Colman calls the what if' modelling capabilities that businesses are beginning to use. ""Not only can they see historic information, they can crate scenarios for the future. You can analyse the impact of cost increases on raw materials, for example, to see what the impact would be on the overall business margin. Or a company that exports to different countries might use models to understand how currency fluctuations affect profits.""The challenge with BI and analytics has always been about cleansing the data and making sure it is accurate and easy to mine for insights. Bad data in, bad data out' was a much used adage. ""It's less of an issue today because a lot of mid-sized businesses will have implemented ERP systems over the last few years, so their data is quite clean,"" explained Colman. ""Where you have a single source of data it makes things quite straightforward.""It gets more complicated, however, if a company has acquired another business that runs different applications. ""To get a common level of reporting, the ETL process and data management capabilities become more of a challenge,"" he warned.",Newspapers,," Accenture541611 , Microsoft Corp511210334614",ACN," Copyright Sunday Business Post Nov 3, 2013"," 3115982391 , 82704692 , 42917 , SBPS , TCRHSBPS20131103tp423445", News," Nov 3, 2013",,, English, English,, Cork,"Nov 3, 2013",Sunday Business Post,2013,,http://search.proquest.com/docview/1448054010?accountid=12768, n/a, Information technology,http://getit.library.nyu.edu/resolve??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anewsstand&amp;atitle=Business+Analytics%3A+Jumping+on+the+analytics+train&amp;title=Sunday+Business+Post&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-11-03&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Sunday+Business+Post&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest CentralHP Enterprise Services launches new cloud-based analytics,"HP announced new cloud-based analytics as a service built on HP's HAVEn Big Data analytics platform, helping clients solve business problems and create new revenue opportunities.",1439578739,"HP announced new cloud-based analytics as a service built on HP's HAVEn Big Data analytics platform, helping clients solve business problems and create new revenue opportunities.About HP:HP creates new possibilities for technology to have a meaningful impact on people, businesses, governments and society.

Robust performance and attribution data for FBX campaigns will be available via the company's new Xaxis Social Analytics Suite.Xaxis clients will have direct access to FBX inventory through Xaxis' proprietary data management platform (DMP), allowing them to plan, execute and analyze campaigns across Facebook and the rest of the digital media universe from a single location.

For instance, an advertiser might identify an increase in performance when pairing a Facebook ad with a specific online video ad shown on a different site. Additionally, the Xaxis Social Analytics Suite offers robust attribution analysis capabilities that extend beyond FBX inventory, providing attribution insight for the entire Facebook site. This will allow advertisers to better understand campaign performance and empower them to make more educated decisions in designing their Facebook strategies.""It is difficult to overstate the impact that Facebook Exchange will have on the entire digital media landscape,"" said Brian Lesser, CEO of Xaxis.

""We would like to see Verizon Wireless add the ability to set per device limits on data use--which could be a big plus, especially for a traveling parent who may need data for navigation and video chat, and needs to make sure that the family data cap isn't depleted by kids watching videos.""Phil Kendall, Director, Wireless Operator Strategies, notes, ""Making data usage levels the main decision for consumers when they select their mobile plan is a good forerunner to the move to Voice over LTE (VoLTE), where voice and messaging become part of the data stream.

The Armonk, N.Y., tech giant didn't disclose financial terms of the deal.""We think the next level of value in security is security analytics and intelligence,"" Robert LeBlanc, senior vice president of IBM middleware software, said in an interview.IBM has benefited from its push toward higher-margin, complex businesses and away from crowded fields where companies can only compete on price. It has been making heavy investments in areas such as emerging countries and business analytics, and the company has said it would spend $20 billion on acquisitions from 2011 to 2015.IBM also said it was setting up a new division within the company, called IBM Security Systems, to combine Q1 with the 10 security acquisitions it has made in the past decade.Q1 Labs Chief Executive Brendan Hannigan will be joining IBM as general manager of the new group, reporting to Mr. LeBlanc. Waltham, Mass.-based Q1 was founded in 2001 and has about 1,800 customers. Mr. Hannigan declined to provide revenue or earnings details for Q1.""The technology is responsible for detection of any unusual behavior,"" Mr. Hannigan said in an interview. ""It's done in as real time as you can get.""Q1 aggregates data and then analyzes the information to detect threats that would otherwise be missed. It also can help run audits and demonstrate compliance with regulations.For example, an employee could be in the office on a Saturday, running an application that allows the employee to access all of the company's customer information. If the employee doesn't normally work on the weekend or access the data at the same time, it can set off a red flag that something is wrong.Meanwhile, Intel Corp.'s McAfee security unit on Tuesday said it was buying NitroSecurity, another company that uses analytical tools to identify and resolve threats within minutes. The company said the deal will allow it to give organizations greater visibility into security threats and vulnerabilities across their entire information technology environment.CLSA analyst Ed Maguire said in a recent note that security is a ""big data"" problem, with massive amounts of information needing to be cleaned and analyzed in order to identify correlations and provide insights related to threats.""The future of cybersecurity is information management--how to organize, correlate and analyze data effectively,"" he said.Write to Shara Tibken at shara.tibken@dowjones.com",Newspapers," Tibken, SharaSharaShara TibkenTibkenShara Tibken"," Hewlett-Packard Co334111334119334611511210 , EMC Corp334112334119511210",IBM," (c) 2011 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The two are partners, with Netezza using IBM hardware.""Speed is critical,"" said Arvind Krishna, general manager of information management at IBM. ""Clients don't have the patience to wait for weeks.""He said analytics, which accounted for about $9 billion of IBM's $95.76 billion in revenue last year, was a significant growth opportunity for the company. IBM employs 6,000 analytics consultants, while Netezza has 500 employees.The deal also comes amid a resurgence in mergers and acquisitions activity. Last month saw an unseasonable burst of deal making, with Thomson Reuters data showing total announced deals of $262 billion, the highest for an August since 1999.Analysts have said this could continue, helped by low interest rates, record cash holdings and low stock market values.Another trend driving deals in technology is the ambition among large vendors to become one-stop shops selling everything from networking and servers to software and services. IBM began moving in that direction in 2007, when it spent $4.7 billion to buy Ottawa business intelligence software specialist Cognos Inc.IBM said in May that it planned to spend about $20 billion in acquisitions through 2015 to expand its software and services business.IBM's top rivals include HP, Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., all of which have announced new services and acquisitions in an effort to offer a broader set of technology services to clients.Analysts also said the deal could spark interest in other data analytics companies including Teradata and smaller, privately owned firms such as ParAccel and Vertica. Teradata shares were up 7.8 per cent.Given the recent, heated bidding war between HP and Dell Inc. over data storage company 3PAR Inc., they said, a rival bid could emerge for Netezza as well. Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W.

Its primary mandate is to prevent and reduce crime by providing comprehensive public safety services when and where they are most needed. The police service turned to IBM to take advantage of analytics technology to spot crime trends and link performance goals from the executive to the constables on the street.With business analytics technology, Edmonton police are able to see data in near real time. They put crime information directly into the hands of front-line patrol officers so they can use it to quickly identify problems, associated trends and locations of crimes to determine their response and problem-solving solutions. The police service has also been able to look at the components of response times -- such as dispatch delays and travel time -- to identify the issues that play a role in overall response time. With this technology, police are able to monitor performance strategically over time and place, and tactically on a day-by-day and call-by-call basis.Crime data analytics is increasingly being recognized worldwide as a powerful tool that enables commanders and frontline staff at law enforcement agencies to make sense of millions of historic incident, offense, arrest and call-for-service records to accurately pinpoint crime rates and patterns. The quick access to relevant information is helping enforcement officials work smarter and make more timely decisions about crime fighting.Impacting Arsons by Tracking the Crime Trends through AnalyticsAs a result of employing IBM analytics technology, Edmonton Police Services is able to make more resources available to effectively deal with a potential increase in arson activity. The agency noticed an upward trend in the crime, based on the instant information made available through analytics. By quickly comparing new information with data from previous years, the police service was able to ascertain that the trend was likely to increase from March to July. Police efforts were ultimately successful in nearly eliminating arsons in that particular area during this period.Recently, the police have begun using analytics reports to inform the public about the crime situation in their neighborhoods. This enables the system to have a direct impact on the public as well.'For us, the bottom-line is to prevent crime, and business analytics reporting has helped us accomplish that,' said John Warden, BI project team lead, Edmonton Police Services.In the future, the force hopes to take advantage of mobile devices to directly disseminate relevant information to officers, regardless of location.'Edmonton Police Services is changing the face of law enforcement,' said Anne Altman, general manager, Global Public Sector, IBM.

With today's news, IBM is taking advantage of its unique combination of software and hardware technology, industry knowledge, Research math sciences and services expertise to help clients make more informed decisions faster than ever before -- accelerating the pace of building a smarter planet.The Smart Analytics System is a single, fine-tuned system optimized with the right balance of software, systems and storage capabilities for deep analytics computing workloads. It can uncover insights and hidden relationships among massive amounts of data -- not just structured information found in databases, but unstructured and incompatible data from such diverse sources as videos, emails, Web sites, podcasts, blogs, wikis, archival data and more. This makes it well-suited to tackle some of the most complex problems associated with areas targeted for stimulus investments, such as financial risk management, smart grids, electronic medical records and management of healthcare costs, education, identity theft and fraud, and food safety.The Smart Analytics System can harness the power of analytics to solve complex business problems as much as three times faster than other systems, while requiring up to 50 percent less storage -- saving both floor space and energy. A powerful analytics system that would have required the time of half a dozen or more technical experts to set up can now be deployed by as few as one, or none at all for smaller configurations. For most configurations, the system can be 'analytics ready' in as few as 12 days.'Our clients are operating in a competitive environment. In addition to acting fast, they have to be right,' said Ambuj Goyal, general manager for IBM Information Management. 'With the Smart Analytics System, we are helping clients take advantage of analytics faster, more efficiently and at a lower cost, helping them achieve better business results and accelerate their return on investment.'The IBM Smart Analytics System delivers a comprehensive and flexible set of capabilities, including business intelligence reporting, analysis, dashboards, and scorecards, data mining, cubing services, text analytics, data warehouse management, storage and server platform. It can also be used by clients or cloud service providers to deliver the power of analytics to private or public cloud services.Analytics in Action - Improving Lives and ProfitsOrganizations around the globe are embracing analytics technology to gain business advantage and better serving their clients. For example:Chicago, IL-based Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBSA), a national federation of 39 independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance companies, is analyzing claim records of tens of millions of members to detect demographic trends. The resulting insights will be used to help employers improve workforce health while better managing costs for the members.'This has the potential to revolutionize the way we deliver healthcare,' said Shirley Lady, Vice President, Business Informatics/BHI for Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. 'Analytics is giving us faster access to the type of information we didn't have before.' For example: analytics has made it much easier and faster to survey large populations and then quickly analyze the prevalence of a chronic diseases, as well as treatment patterns.Headquartered in Little Rock, AR, Dillard's Inc. is a fashion apparel and home furnishings retailer with more than 300 stores. Analytics plays a key role in the company's strategy to combat the tough economic climate. Using analytics, Dillard's is able to obtain valuable insights into inventory management, vendor relationship management and customer spending patterns, which has resulted in increased efficiencies for the company.Rooms to Go, a furniture retailer based in Seffner, FL, is also using analytics to also detect buying patterns of customers, such as which furniture pieces and categories are the best sellers, by state and customer type. With these insights, Rooms To Go is able to target repeat customers more effectively by predicting which products consumers prefer and would likely buy next.Sterling Savings Bank, headquartered in Spokane, Wash., serves more than 25,000 businesses and 175,000 consumers in five states. As a leading community bank in the Pacific Northwest and the largest commercial bank in the state of Washington, Sterling uses business analytics to better understand and serve its clients - providing a better banking experience by anticipating their needs at different stages of their lives.Analytics technology holds tremendous promise for companies of all sizes to make more intelligent decisions and gain a competitive advantage. However, until now, acquiring, configuring and fine-tuning an analytics solution to solve specific problems and uncover breakthrough insights has required not only specific technical skills, but experts in applying analytics software for specific vertical industry applications. This has put analytics out of reach for many companies. With the new Smart Analytics System, IBM is responding to this need by not only providing its technical expertise, but also by delivering a comprehensive system that offers a streamlined assessment and the consulting expertise necessary to bring the power of analytics to clients quickly, at an affordable price.With this announcement, IBM is expanding its portfolio to meet the needs of the high-growth analytics market.

The offering, which was rolled out in the United States in 2006, gives companies with fleets of vehicles the critical line of sight into how their assets are performing in real time.""Now more than ever, businesses are looking for smart, efficient ways to reduce operating costs while simultaneously increasing productivity. Our solution provides an answer, offering a powerful suite of back-office fleet support services with robust analytics all on one easy to use integrated platform,"" says Stephen Ulanoski, General Manager, GE Capital Solutions Telematics program.Visibility, Knowledge, Competitive AdvantageGE's comprehensive telematics solution provides web-based access to vehicle asset performance metrics including CO2 emissions as well as related alerts, trend charts, exception reports, and customizable mapping. The integrated solution not only allows customers to see in real time where their assets are; it offers clear strategies for improving performance and puts them on their way to greening their fleet operations.Click here (http://www.dwjtv.com/clip/wm/prv/genel5_hw_9.asx) to watch a brief video that explains telematics in more detail.GE's six-sigma trained fleet telematics experts compile more than 100 customized reports. These allow businesses to take into account stop frequency, stop duration, and drive time, along with many other critical data elements demanded by diverse fleet types. The reports and analysis helps customers understand the impact of each on their business.""For example, if it takes 30 minutes to visit one customer and 60 minutes another, the data and our analysis helps our clients understand what's behind that. Once that's captured and the costs are understood, we help our clients take proactive steps-whether it is better route planning or more strategic resource allocation and pricing-to optimize the operation. The results are immediate and significant, delivering the competitive advantage our customers want and need, especially now,"" Amit Jain, Product Manager, GE Capital Solutions Telematics program.Big ResultsAugmented with additional current fleet data, actionable recommendations provided by dedicated telematics consultants enable significant operational improvement in a fleet's performance and cost management. On average, customers have realized double-digit percentage improvements in worker productivity, expanded business capacity, fuel consumption, carbon emissions, accident rates, and overtime costs.Moreover, because delivery, sales and service calls are completed more efficiently, businesses using telematics are better able to meet their customer service level agreements. This strengthens customer loyalty and drives more revenue.For a leading pest control company with 1,000 vehicles, the monthly telematics benefits alone have resulted in a savings of: 190,000 litres of fuel; 20,000 hours of drive time; 450 metric tons of CO2 savings and 8,000 hours of operational planning.High & Immediate ReturnsGE's telematics solution is available for a flat monthly subscription fee. Customers pay for the product as they realize the benefits, instead of making a significant up front capital investment. As a result, they quickly realize an ROI--which can be anywhere from 2X to 8X-- which can increase over time.About GE Capital SolutionsGE Capital Solutions Canada (www.gecapitalsolutions.ca) is a leading provider of financial and fleet management solutions to businesses operating in a broad range of economic sectors, including construction, transportation, energy and manufacturing.

However, with the 5800, Nokia may gain significant traction because the resistive touchscreen can be used with a finger, stylus or plectrum, meeting the needs of users across a diverse range of culturally-different regions.""Steve Entwistle, VP of Strategy Analytics' Strategic Technologies Practice adds, ""Nokia's decision to use resistive touchscreen has not caught us totally by surprise. Users in many Asian countries prefer to use a stylus or plectrum to interface with touchscreen devices. Capacitive touchscreens like the iPhone can only be used with an un-gloved finger. We will be reflecting the trend back towards resistive technology in our revised forecast report which will be published later this month.""Companies that are most likely to benefit from this product announcement include Elo TouchSystems (Tyco), 3M and Nissha, vendors of resistive touchscreen panels. Other vendors including Synaptics, ALPS and Balda who make capacitive touchscreen components are unlikely to see any negative effects in the short-term though, because touchscreen phones in general are still showing significant growth.About Strategy AnalyticsStrategy Analytics, Inc offers high frequency market intelligence on Automotive Electronics and Entertainment, Broadband Connected Home, Mobile & Wireless Products & Systems, and Virtual Worlds. http://strategyanaytics.com",Wire Feeds," AnonymousAnonymousAnonymousAnonymous"," Nokia Inc334210 , M2 Communications Ltd , Analytics Inc",NOK, (Copyright M2 Communications Ltd. 2008)," 1566468381 , 40559621 , 33004 , MTPW , MCMT200810030E57B16F", News," Oct 3, 2008",,, English, English,, Coventry,"Oct 3, 2008",M2 Presswire,2008,,http://search.proquest.com/docview/444384848?accountid=12768, n/a,,http://getit.library.nyu.edu/resolve??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anewsstand&amp;atitle=STRATEGY+ANALYTICS%3A+STRATEGY+ANALYTICS%3A+Nokia%27s+Touchscreen+5800+XpressMusic&amp;title=M2+Presswire&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-10-03&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Anonymous&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=M2+Presswire&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest CentralSTRATEGY ANALYTICS: Strategy Analytics: Sony Ericsson and Nokia Try for Apple's Crown; Sony Ericsson Launches Bundled Music Service for Operators,"Boston, MA -- The Strategy Analytics Wireless Media Strategies report, ""Can Nokia Challenge Apple's Digital Music Dominance,"" highlighted the potential impact of bundled music and mobile handset offerings on the digital music industry.

(Nasdaq: SPSS) to increase customer loyalty by proactively anticipating customer needs in helicopter fleets. Sikorsky is a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX).Sikorsky helicopters are used by all five branches of the United States armed forces, along with military services and commercial operators in more than 40 nations.Sikorsky offers customers various maintenance assurance programs to help improve aircraft availability and operate their fleet at a known cost. Included in this offering is the Total Assurance Program (TAP), covering up to 98 percent of costs related to parts and services.The organization sought a software solution to help identify and predict equipment maintenance for helicopter customers, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction. Sikorsky selected SPSS Predictive Analytics text mining and data mining software and its Predictive Analytics enterprise-wide enabling platform to analyze helicopter and pilot data collected by the aircraft health and usage monitoring system and flight maintenance log records.SPSS Predictive Analytics gives Sikorsky the leading technology to analyze structured data, such as historical and current information on individual helicopters, and to use text mining for the unstructured data, including pilot and maintenance crew fault logs.By incorporating information from all data sources, Sikorsky will be able to determine the relationships between how the aircraft is being operated and maintained and the consumption of parts. The deeper understanding of these correlations will allow Sikorsky to take proactive action to reduce direct maintenance costs.Ted Kell, manager of logistics technology at Sikorsky Aircraft, said, ""The incorporation of SPSS into our customer maintenance program supports our continued goal of being recognized worldwide as the number one vertical flight company that serves our customers with exceptional one-to-one service.""Jack Noonan, SPSS chairman, president and CEO, said, ""Sikorsky Aircraft's investment in SPSS will enable the organization to be proactive about customer loyalty, predictive maintenance and, most importantly, safety of its machines.
