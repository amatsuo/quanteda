Importing Documents into a Quanteda Corpus
========================================================

One way of creating a Quanteda corpus is to combine a vector of texts with a dataframe of attributes. 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
