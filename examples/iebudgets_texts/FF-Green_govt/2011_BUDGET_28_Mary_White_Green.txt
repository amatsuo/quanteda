I am delighted to be able to speak on this year’s budget and to talk about the budgetary allocations for which I have responsibility. I also want to speak briefly about my party’s input into the budget.

There were no easy decisions, as everybody in this House knows. Every choice was made with acute awareness of how difficult these decisions will be for everybody in the country and they were taken with a heavy heart but with a full commitment to prioritising those most in need.

In the areas for which I have responsibility — equality, integration and human rights — I have worked hard to protect the necessary funding for the equality and integration framework. Our priority was to protect funding for the equality and rights bodies and I believe that the 2011 allocations — over €3 million for the Equality Authority, €1.46 million for the Irish Human Rights Commission and the 9% increase for the Equality Tribunal to €2.5 million — will ensure that these really important bodies can carry on their core work in promoting equality, combating discrimination and promoting, and, indeed, protecting, human rights. Indeed, last week I authorised €70,000 in funding from the Office of the Minister for Integration to the Equality Authority for a workplace diversity programme which the authority runs in conjunction with the social partners.

I have supported the equality and rights bodies’ initiatives since I became Minister of State, be it the Equality Authority in launching a recent report into homophobic bullying, the Irish [496]Human Rights Commission inquiry into the John Paul Centre in Galway, or the diligent work of the Equality Tribunal, in progressing cases of alleged discrimination and in conducting their work effectively at a time of increased cases over the past number of years. These are valued bodies, they do good work and I am proud of their ongoing commitment to a more equal Ireland.

The Office of the Minister for Integration will see a reduction, and this was a difficult decision. However, it will receive €4.18 million and the European Refugee Fund will receive €1.58 million. It has been a good year at the Office of the Minister for Integration with the establishment of the Ministerial Council on Integration, which has provided a forum for migrants to speak directly to me about how they feel about living and working in Ireland and any perceived discrimination or racism in our country. All four initial fora have now met and this institution will be a feature of the budget next year and in the years to follow.

On a good news story, next year I will be funding a migrant media interns project in which two migrants will be given six months’ placement with local or regional newspapers to help local media document the experiences, issues and perspectives facing the migrant community in our country.

There was a positive response from local authorities to calls for funding proposals and I received proposals from local authorities which had not applied for funding in previous years. I am confident that local authorities, national organisations, sporting bodies and anti-racism initiatives which were funded this year will be adequately supported again in 2011.

I am pleased I have been able to protect funding for gender equality and Traveller support projects. My Department will still be providing over €0.5 million to national women’s organisations. I pay tribute here to the National Women’s Council of Ireland and Cúram for the voice they provide in progressing the agenda of gender equality in Ireland.

Recently, I met the Norwegian Minister for Defence, Ms Greta Faremo, whose reflections on gender equality were that experience proves that gender equality and full participation of women is a precondition for growth, development and peace and those countries who neglect that need pay for it by slowing down on their path to progress.

I agree with Ms Faremo that societies that fail to tap the full talents of 50% of their population are less likely to achieve political legitimacy, social cohesion and economic growth — the essential building blocks of peace. I am working hard to promote more women in politics and I will be launching an initiative on that shortly.

I have plenty of time.

In times of economic difficulty focus has to be maintained on employment and enterprise supports. In this context the Equality for Women Measure funding, which my Department provides, has been fully protected. Some €2.42 million is being allocated for the gender mainstreaming subhead, which will fund the latest strand of the Equality for Women Measure, which is offering 1,800 women a variety of training and support options to enable them to prepare for employment, re-train, or start a business.

I care deeply about investing in supports for the Traveller community.

This community remains vulnerable, but I have given time and effort to engaging with representative groups and individuals throughout the year, and I am pleased that the equality monitoring allocation for 2011 will ensure current initiatives continue.

The funding of Traveller Focus Week and a very positive conflict mediation pilot project in the midlands will, I hope, also continue next year. The project has been successful in reducing conflict, which is beneficial to both the Traveller and the settled communities.

I want to make a few brief comments on the Green Party’s input into the budget protecting the economy and the environment. We have fought hard to ensure that we protect education. Education is a vital investment in our children and the country’s future. Talking to teachers right across the country, and, indeed, in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, the one message I was hearing was, “Please do not increase the pupil-teacher ratio”. I myself am a former teacher, and, indeed, the Minister, Deputy Pat Carey, is as well, and I am delighted to say that the pupil-teacher ratio has been maintained. It will give our children a great headstart in the years to come. When our economy comes out of this slough of despond the jobs will be there and we will have provided good education.

There also will be no cut in the number of SNAs or national education psychologists. I hope Deputy Crawford is pleased with that.

These are important statements to parents and students that a good learning environment for our children is something we value, and that we want all children to be able to access third level education. That is why I am delighted there is no return of third level fees.

Before I finish, I want to refer to the old age pension, which we have protected.

Many of our elderly have contributed to the State all their lives and rely on the old age pension. We have given them some peace of mind and security for the year ahead,

Some of the older pensioners, who did not benefit from the experience of the Celtic tiger years, some of whom may be infirm or suffering from poor health, [498]now have the security of a pension that is protected, and I am proud of that. Particularly in the years ahead, we must ensure that they have that pension.

The economic stimuli in this budget are components which the Green Party, as a pro-enterprise party, is pleased to see in it. There is continuation of the corporation tax exemptions for start-up companies, incentives for the green economy — continuation of the accelerated capital allowance for energy efficient equipment, sustained funding for forestry, which, as I come from a rural constituency, I am aware is important for our farmers to tap into as a means of securing more revenue, and increased investment in home insulation grants — improvements to the business expansion scheme soon to be called the employment investment incentive, and significant capital spending in important areas like public transport and water services infrastructure. We in the Green Party recognise the importance of stimulating and developing our economy in a sustainable way.

Of equal if not of more importance than all other aspects of the budget I mentioned, leadership was shown in the steps taken on politicians’ pay, car-pooling for Ministers and reductions in other ministerial utilities such as the Government jet.

These are small steps, but they are necessary steps. I am reminded of my old history teacher in the Ursuline convent in Waterford, the long-since deceased Angela McGrath. When we were struggling boarding students she used to quote Winston Churchill to us and she used to say, “never never never never ever give up”. We on this side of the House will not give up, to get things right for our country.
