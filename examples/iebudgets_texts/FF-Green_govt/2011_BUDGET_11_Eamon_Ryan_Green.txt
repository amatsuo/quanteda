I was quoting a colleague, Mr. Sweeney, who was using the metaphor that we are in a very hard winter but the sense in this country is sometimes one can get a good summer and the land will recover, that we have real capabilities in this country that will thrive after we get over some of the mistakes, some of the dead wood of the past that we must remove.

We are starting to see some of that dead wood removed in this budget for we have had, as the Minister for Finance stated, a taxation system that was not fit for purpose in a range of different ways. First, as stated by the Commission on Taxation, which we appointed and which has done its good work, it was too narrowly focussed on property taxation, short-term transactions and income taxes, and within the income tax system, too narrowly based in terms of who is paying. There was a large section that was not included within that. As difficult as it is to broaden the tax base, it is, as the Commission on Taxation and others have stated, the right thing to have done.

It would also be right for us to do what the Commission on Taxation recommends, to avail of this opportunity to broaden the tax base into other areas, including more stable forms of property taxation that will not get us back into a bubble and bust territory. That also is something towards which we are moving in this budget. The change in the stamp duty arrangements which was recommended by the commission — it recommended a zero rate but to reduce it to 1% is close — is a step in the direction. It is to be followed in subsequent years with other measures and this will lead to a more sustainable property tax system, which we urgently need and which was one of the main reasons we got into such difficulties. That is something I welcome, particularly for those who are caught in difficult mortgage situations today. It, among the other measures that we have made, may help them to trade down and get out of the debt difficulties they have.

We also had too narrow a tax base in that the very wealthy in this country were not paying their fair share. Following yesterday, on the back of other changes and further ones to come, there will be a significant increase in real taxation payments by those who are very wealthy who in the past were able to avoid paying their fair share of tax by using tax reliefs and the special pension arrangements. That is a critical and important change that we have agreed in this budget.

We must also generate our wealth in a much broader way and get away from our obsession with property.

This is also facilitated in the budget in the way in which spending on enterprise, research and development and education have been maintained. At a time when we are making very difficult decisions to cut back areas, it was a critical strategic decision to state we will try to [467]maintain spending in these areas in recognition that such enterprise from educated people is the best way of us developing sustainable economic recovery.

This involved incredibly difficult policy decisions because not cutting as severely as one could in areas such as education means in other areas, such as social welfare in particular and health, reductions are being made for which it is very hard for anyone to argue in favour. I can only state that we do it not in the interests of creating a less equal society but in a real attempt to try to get our public finances working and to get our economy and jobs working so people will not be reliant on social welfare payments. For those who require it, there will still be maintained a basic protection in our society recognising that those who cannot work their way through enterprise or by other means do have to be protected, be they pensioners or other people in similar categories who cannot rely on their own endeavours. These changes are very difficult; they were not easy to make but it was done in this context.

There are other changes we need to make and deadwood we need to remove. The most significant of these is that we need a change in ethics, particularly in Irish business. We got into banking difficulties and difficulties with the property bubble because people were thinking of themselves and not of the consequences of their actions. People chased targets such as performance bonuses and high pay returns rather than thought about the consequences of the business decisions they were making. This will have to change in Irish business as we move out of the Celtic tiger period into a new period where we seek new growth.

People in this country will be forced to ask hard questions and look at the detail. In this country, we have a habit of saying things will be all right. There is an attractive aspect to this but things were not all right. In the boardrooms of senior companies and particular banks and in our regulatory system people were not willing to ask the hard questions. This will have to change. Paying attention to detail and getting the detail right in everything we do in the public and private sectors is also a consequence. Changes will have to come out of this unfortunate lesson we have learned in the past three, five and ten years.

There will also have to be consequences. It is deeply frustrating and difficult for those in the political system to see our legal system not being able to state that certain actions taken were wrong and should be punished in an appropriate way. We need this to happen. In this country, we operate under a system of freedoms provided by a Constitution which recognises individual rights. For all the flaws in our Constitution the rights protected in it and by our legal system are crucial freedoms which we need to maintain and protect while at the same time seeking justice so that people face the consequences of what has been done. I hope we can get this balance, difficult as it is, right. There is also freedom of speech in this country, which is important. Our press is free to report as it sees fit. It can also lead people to a better understanding of what is happening through the freedom it can exercise.

We need a change in politics away from the politics of populism which got us into some of these difficulties. The easy solution was to state that money was available and one might as well spend it. As we in the House all recognise, too often we work on a constituency-oriented basis rather than on a policy-based basis. This was one of the primary causes for us failing to see the policy mistakes that were taken in recent years and to adjust accordingly. This will have to change. We will also have to change so there is no question of undue corporate influence clouding political policy judgment. I am very keen to see the Government delivering on its commitment to end corporate donations so that a hint or possibility of such influence does not exist. These are some of the key changes we need to make if we are to learn lessons from what went wrong in recent years.

[468]More than anything, we need politics in which hard policy choices are made. We need the public service to be managed in a very effective way. Whoever is in Government faces a huge challenge in the daily business of politics to drive our public services, to take risks and to manage resources more effectively. From my vantage point as a Minister with responsibility for areas of economic development, I see real opportunities for development in the new digital economy, in a green economy, in our food industries and in our financial services industry. It is possible, but first and foremost it needs political change and political responsibility. As the Minister for Finance stated in his speech yesterday, it requires confidence in ourselves.

Yesterday, I was somewhat encouraged and some confidence returned to me when I saw the response in the Chamber to the Budget Statement. Other commentators wondered why it was so muted compared to the usual Punch and Judy show we have on budget day. I took it as a sign of optimism that there is recognition on all sides of the House of the seriousness of the situation and the responsibility we all share to start addressing it. I listened to Deputy Michael Noonan and I very much empathised with his quoting Michael Collins on the need to grow again our country and have that sense of love returned to it. At lunchtime, I listened to the Taoiseach on the radio stating rightly that love of country is instilled in every one of our parties. We need to use this common cause — this common love and affection we have for our country — to provide clear and practical politics to help us out. As the Taoiseach stated, we cannot rely on false promises.

We need to work in detail on the changes not only in this budget but in the next three or four budgets to come to get us out of the difficult times we are in and the hard winter we are having, into a spring which can grow. I am confident we can do this. Parties on all sides of the House, and my party in particular, have a role to play because those green shoots will and should be green.
