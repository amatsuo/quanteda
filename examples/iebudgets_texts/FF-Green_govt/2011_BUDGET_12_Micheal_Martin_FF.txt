I welcome this opportunity to make my contribution to the budget debate along with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan. The key imperative facing the country is to chart a credible pathway over the coming years towards economic recovery and towards emerging from what is an unprecedented economic crisis. We have not seen the likes of this globally or in Ireland since the great crash of the late 1920s. It has taken a collective effort by the nations of the world to prevent the collapse of the global economy. There is significant interdependence in the world economy today that perhaps did not exist in earlier decades. It is important that this European and global context is not lost sight of in terms of where Ireland now finds itself. Since we joined the monetary union and since the phenomenon of globalisation, the world is a much smaller place; it is far more interconnected and the impacts of decisions we take here and elsewhere can influence Ireland and Europe. This is particularly true with regard to banking. We cannot act unilaterally with regard to banking as some people have suggested or superficially put forward as panaceas for the banking crisis. We cannot act unilaterally in this regard. That is very clear.

Some people sneered at the Minister for Finance for suggesting there was a turning point, but if one looks at the sheer decline in 2009 and the contraction in GNP and GDP terms and then looks at 2010 when that situation flattened and there was 0.3% growth in GDP, it is clear that there has been a substantial stabilisation of the economy. If one adds to this the modern dimension of our economy, namely, the industrial and export sectors, the economy showed significant resilience in the eye of the storm during the crisis itself when we witnessed a decline of 4% in exports in 2009 when other countries witnessed export declines of up to 16%. This year our exports have shown significant growth as they have increased by 7% in real terms in the first half of this year. This is a significant indicator of activity, productivity and regained [469]competitiveness in this sector of the economy which, everyone agrees, is the engine of growth for the future and the way towards economic recovery. Manufacturing output was up 12% in the third quarter, export orders remained strong in October and the live register figures are down for the third month in row. Another key factor in terms of the public finances is that the underlying budget deficit stabilised at approximately 11.6% prior to the budget. This is important, because many people have suggested that the €14 billion correction that has occurred since 2008 has not worked or that it was unnecessary. If we had not made that correction, we would not have up to a €20 billion deficit but would be in a completely unsustainable position in terms of the public finances. That would threaten the very fabric of our social security and welfare systems and our health and education services. The answer does not lie in the wholesale reversal of the programme of getting our public finances in order. As our colleagues across Europe have said, we need deeper and more rapid action on a number of fronts.

The Labour Party has suggested that we could, for example, have worked on a €4.5 billion cutback this year. That argument is disingenuous because nobody has mentioned the growing nature of debt servicing costs. The longer we postpone the change, the more costs we build up down the line and that is the major problem with the Labour Party’s €4.5 billion approach or with the idea that we can continue to delay corrective action. Both the Labour Party and Fine Gael have questioned the growth rates that underpin the budget and the four year plan. I suggest it is no longer enough for the Opposition parties just to question the growth figures. The plan the Fine Gael Party put forward accepts the Government growth figure and it forms the basis of the Fine Gael projections for the next four years. The figure also forms the basis of the Labour Party budget. The Commission has a different growth perspective.

If that is the case, I suggest Fine Gael should adopt its own growth estimate.

This is a transparent process and there are many different economic models. It is not enough for people to play it both ways or for them to pencil in our growth figure, but doubt it will happen.

If Fine Gael doubts the projected growth will happen, it should put forward its growth figure based on its economic modelling and on the variety of perspectives and economic models there are and base its four year plan on that.

I have noted that the Fine Gael four year plan accepts the Government’s growth targets as the basis for what it has put into its plan.

The competitiveness agenda is very important in terms of job creation and of ensuring we have an economy that responds to the need to increase exports. We export goods and services and we must ensure that those goods are world class in terms of quality and technology. In many instances, they represent solutions to global problems, be they related to energy, climate, businesses, agriculture or food. Some very exciting companies have [470]emerged over the past decade with the support of Enterprise Ireland and the pro-business environment in Ireland that has facilitated the growth of a significant number of new types of SMEs in the food, technology, life science and digital areas and in internationally traded services. We must continue to pin our hopes on these areas, which is the reason we have put such significant investment into the enterprise Estimates for the next three to four years. It is also the reason we are not just maintaining the level of investment in research and development area but are making modest increases in it over the next number of years. We want to ensure that the critical mass of research capacity we have built up can be deployed to ensure greater commercialisation of research and new products and services that will bring about new jobs and greater exports.

Notwithstanding all of the challenges we face, it is important to acknowledge that over the past ten years we have transformed the research landscape in this country. In 1997 when I became Minister for Education, there was no research budget. We have transformed the situation, particularly in terms of the campuses of our universities, institutes of technology and specialist research centres. We have also transformed it in terms of the quality of personnel, both home grown and those from overseas. The evidence in terms of how the IDA’s portfolio of inward investment has changed bears this out. As the Taoiseach mentioned this morning, some 50% of the projects run by the IDA this year are research-based projects. Prior to this we had seen growth to approximately 40% of new projects coming in being based on research. These projects are not just involved in research for its own sake, but underpin the high end manufacturing presence we continue to have in Ireland in many sectors, but more specifically in the life sciences and ICT. These remain strong sectors for our economy and we must continue to focus on them as a basis for growth. As a result of the development of the export sector, domestic demand will return in time to sustainable levels.

Finally, we need a change in politics and in our political system and it is important we do not return to “politics as usual”.

However, I am a bit more pessimistic as a result of what I witnessed yesterday in terms of protestations. I get the sense from the Labour Party that its basic political objective is to win as many votes as it can at all costs and to take the consequences after the election in terms of the implementation of policy and the harsh realities.

I acknowledge the Fine Gael four year plan has some credibility, but I feel that the Fine Gael leader probably did not mean what he said this morning when he said there would be no income tax increases under the Fine Gael Party in 2011. That is not credible and it undermines the centre piece of the plan Fine Gael published last week. The nit-picking that is going on suggests to people that there are alternatives. If one signs up to a saving of €6 billion, that must involve pain and must impact on people, unfortunately. I acknowledge this is difficult and tough for people at all levels.

There should be political reform. I agree with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the issue of corporate donations. The legislation on that will be progressed by Government and should be in place [471]before the calling of the election, because that is important in terms of the conduct of the election.

We are committed to reform. I am committed to a regime which will change dramatically the whole practice of large corporate donations to politics. All the analysts say we need to change our politics. Let us not lose the opportunity afforded by this watershed period in our history in terms of economics to do the thing properly.

My concern is that the type of exchange Deputy Durkan requires does not fill me with confidence that change will happen

To be fair, Deputy Durkan’s opportunity has been coming for a long time. I will now hand over to my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Finneran.
