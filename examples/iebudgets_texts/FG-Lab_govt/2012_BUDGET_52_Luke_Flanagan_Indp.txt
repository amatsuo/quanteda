I hope no one minds if I disagree with the budget because if I have a problem with some of its provisions, that is what the Opposition is meant to do. While Fianna Fáil undoubtedly destroyed this country and has made life hell for people, another thing that destroyed the country was a lack of a decent Opposition in the last Dáil. The present Administration’s dislike of an Opposition is proof that it does not understand what opposition is.

The Government has made choices, although it has reversed some of them because they did not sound too good. Nevertheless, it made those decisions and Members now know what it feels about certain matters. The Government had a choice between increases in VAT or in income tax. It is undeniable that people on low income spend a far greater proportion of their money on VAT-rated items than do those in higher income brackets. The poorest 10% pay 14.9%, while the richest 10% only pay 7%. Social Justice Ireland produced an excellent document that explained the effective tax rates following the budgets for the years 2000, 2008 and 2012. It demonstrated that there was room for manoeuvre to increase income tax on the richest in our society. This is something I would have expected the Labour Party to do but it has decided not to. As Sinn Féin managed to put together proposals and found this money, I would have thought the socialists in government also would have been able to do it.

The Government had a choice as to the items on which to apply the additional VAT. It had a choice between concert tickets and toothpaste and a choice between caviar and children’s toys. It decided to apply the tax to toothpaste rather than to caviar and to children’s toys, rather than to concert tickets.

That was very fair.

The Government also had a choice in respect of rent allowance. Just as much money could have been saved by making the landlord take 100% of this cut. Instead, the Government has made the financially weak bear equal pain. Rents in rural Ireland are being kept artificially high because of rent allowance and this issue must be tackled. In another version of this phenomenon, namely, the rental accommodation scheme, or as I like to call it, the rental accommodation scam, some landlords in Roscommon are in receipt of double the current market value. The Government should tackle this issue before hitting the poor and vulnerable.

The Government also had choices in respect of health. For example, it could have hit consultants’ pay. A maximum cap on consultants’ pay of €150,000 would release €100 million to the Exchequer. The Government could have taken €7 million out of that €100 million, instead of taking it from young people with disabilities. I apologise: the Government now has changed its mind about that proposal. However, the problem is that it changed its mind because it got bad publicity about it and not because it cares tuppence about someone with a disability. If it did, it would not have proposed this measure in the first place.

I have called for the legalisation of cannabis and will continue to so do. This is not very popular but just because I hear it is not popular does not mean I will change my mind. Moreover, the research department has done some investigation on that issue for me and has estimated the legalisation of cannabis would be worth approximately €470 million to the economy. Would that not be better than hitting the poor?

As for education, the Government had a choice, particularly with regard to third level education. It had a choice of hitting the lecturers, who yet again are in receipt of exorbitant pay, or the families who already are in a living hell when trying to pay the bills. The Government chose to hit families with an additional charge of €250. Why did the socialists not hit the well-paid lecturers? I cannot work it out and do not know the reason.

As for road tax, I believe car tax should be scrapped altogether. I do not suggest this should be done in the same way that Jack Lynch got rid of certain taxes. He even induced my mother, a sworn Fine Gaeler, to vote for him.

I propose getting rid of it and replacing it in another way by placing the tax directly on the fuel. This would effect savings in two ways. First, it would lead to savings in the paper-pushing associated with operating the current scheme. In addition, it would mean that tourists would be able to contribute to the cost of our roads, as they also buy petrol when visiting. For anyone who makes the argument that this measure would put off tourists, why not use the money raised from the proposed increase in road tax, which the Government intends to give to bankers, by putting it towards a reduction in airport taxes? That would increase the number of tourists.

On fuel allowance, the Government had an option whereby it would have cost them no more than the reduction from 34 to 26 weeks of giving people a block or single payment. People could then buy their fuel in bulk. In other words, instead of buying approximately 80 bales of briquettes, they could buy two loads of turf. If one paid the allowance to them all at once, one would make the same saving.

I asked a question in the Dáil as to the reason this could not be done. I was given the lazy answer that if they got a job, they would have the money and one would never get it back from them. However, if the Government really wanted to do it, it would work out a way to do it.

This budget was meant to be about reform but where is it? I spent six years on Roscommon County Council and while good people work there, the problem is that there is no accountability. Billions of euro are spent between roads and all the other services provided by local government but there is no accountability. I was mayor of Roscommon County Council last year and the director of services with responsibility for finance threatened to leave the room if I sought further information on the budget while attempting to save money. The reason he could do this is that county councillors have no power. I am delighted to see the Minister of State nod in agreement because that gives me some hope. Accountability should be brought to local government. The introduction of directly elected mayors would achieve two things. First, a great deal of money would be saved and second, the Government would get me out of here because I would run for that position. I would love to get County Roscommon off its knees.


Approximately 450,000 people are unemployed and although the Minister, Deputy Burton, talks about forcing people off the dole, one does not need to do this. Perhaps one needs to do it to a certain extent, but I note one would force people into taking jobs ahead of other people who want them. Moreover, they probably would not do a good job. One does not need to force people off the dole. Unfortunately, not alone are people being forced off the dole but they are being forced to engage in schemes that no longer are sustainable because of the reduction in material budgets. How does this help employment?


How does the reduction in grants to insulate houses help employment? It is the only remaining opportunity for the few people left in the building industry.

The issue of mental health supposedly was the good news story of the budget, in that the promise of €35 million was met. I am delighted by this but one should consider the causes of mental illness and depression. One major cause is environmental factors or in other words, the world in which a person lives. In addition, there are genetic reasons. However, with this budget the Government has just increased the environmental dangers of increasing mental health problems to a phenomenal extent. Despair is abroad as a result of the budget. The previous Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the others who now are retired had their pensions cut by less than some of those in receipt of social welfare. How the hell can the Government agree with that?

I got a letter from a lady today who wanted to say the following to the Members opposite and she asked me if I would pass on her message. She said she would like to raise the issue on behalf of lone parents who also have children with special needs and disabilities. She said the cut in the lone parent’s allowance and the age of her kids means it will affect her in a really bad way. She also said that since she is a lone parent of a child with autism, she already has to fight to retain the special needs assistant for the school and everything else that goes hand in hand with raising a child with a disability living in rural Ireland. She wrote that she had to give up work in September as her son was sick and she cannot afford to pay someone €21 an hour so she cannot go to work. She wrote that her parents are in their seventies and her mum helps her out but she cannot do so for much longer because she is getting older and she is no longer able to help her. She also wrote: “What, Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan, are you going to do for me on this one?”

All I can do is appeal to and beg the Members opposite not to hit the poorest in this society. It will not help anyone. The Government says the rich will leave the country if it taxes them more. The rich are far more likely to leave this country if the Government goes down the road it is going down because it will not be safe for its members to leave their houses because society will fall apart and, as a result, this country will go to hell. Do not let this happen.
