After weeks of cynical Government leaks and scaremongering, the Government has produced a budget which is devoid of hope for working people, lower and middle income families, the elderly, children and the poor. It targets some of the most vulnerable in society for cuts and stealth taxes. Gheall an Rialtas buiséad bunaithe ar cothromas, postanna agus athchóiriú, ach ní dhearna sé sin.

A family of two adults and three children with a household income of €150,000 a year will lose €1,052 as a result of this budget. The same size family on social welfare will lose more —€1,078. Where is the fairness in that? Nuair a rinne an Taoiseach a chraolachán, dúirt sé go raibh postanna le cruthú, thagair sé do phostanna cúig uaire déag agus labhair sé faoin gá atá ann obair a chruthú. Dúirt sé: “Work provides focus. Work gives us independence. Work gives our families hope.” Ach ansin, chuaigh sé in aghaidh postanna a chruthú.

The €750 million cuts to the capital budget will mean the loss of between 6,000 and 9,000 jobs. The Government is also committed to cutting 6,000 public service jobs. The money taken out of the pockets of low and middle income families is money taken out of the community, out of local shops and businesses. This will also cost jobs. The Government has already accepted, in its medium fiscal report published four weeks ago, that there will be 390,000 people on the dole in 2015. The jobs crisis would be much worse but for emigration. Since the start of the year, 54,000 of our mainly young people have left for foreign shores. Today there are 444,000 citizens on the live register. That is more than when Fine Gael and Labour won the election with an entirely different manifesto and it is an indictment of their policies and a reflection of their failure. It makes a nonsense of any commitment they have expressed to create jobs.

As for reform, the big wages of the political elite have hardly been touched. A token sum was taken from their super pensions. That is hardly reform. In Opposition, Fine Gael and the Labour Party railed against Fianna Fáil, but in Government they seek to emulate them by delivering a budget in which the young, the elderly, the sick, those on disability, lone parents, students and part-time workers are expected to pay for the greed of the golden circle, the political elites, the developers and the bankers. Despite all the pre-election promises, child benefit has been cut. That cut will cost a four-children family €432 in 2012 and €768 in 2013. “Protect child benefit. Vote Labour” declared the Labour Party posters before the general election. “We will maintain social welfare rates” declared the Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government. In 2009, the Minister for Social Protection said “Child benefit is keeping many families afloat. It is keeping bread on the table, and it is paying the food bills of a huge number of families.” I agree with her. She was right then but she is wrong now. During the general election campaign, the Tánaiste went as far as to say that cuts to child benefit would be a make or break issue for the Labour Party in coalition.

Since then circumstances have worsened for families and, in particular, for children. Child benefit is of even greater importance now than when the Government assumed office but that has not stopped Fine Gael or the Labour Party doing yet another U-turn and breaking yet another election promise.

The fact is these reductions in child benefit are an attack on children in low income families. The poorest families in the State have been hardest hit by the budget and lone parents have been deliberately targeted. Under the budget, the upper age limit for the youngest child for new claimants of the one parent family payment will be reduced to seven years on a phased basis. This means that by 2014, lone parents of children aged seven will be deemed available for full-time work, despite the fact we are in a recession. There are no jobs and there is no comprehensive affordable child care or after school care. How can these parents go out into the workforce? The budget also reduces income disregard, that is, the amount a lone parent can earn while still being allowed to claim the full one parent family payment. That means parents who parent alone will have to give up part-time, low paid jobs. It removes the incentive to work.

Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised a new Ireland based on an end to cronyism. We all know now that it is still jobs for the boys at the top as Fine Gael and the Labour Party have appointed more than 20 people with connections to both to senior positions on State bodies and within the Judiciary.


Moreover, on 14 occasions Ministers and the Taoiseach have breached their own pay cap to award higher salaries to their special advisers. Just this week we saw the controversy in regard to a former Fine Gael director of communications and now special adviser to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton. The Taoiseach saw fit to intervene directly to seek this pay rise of €35,000 for a party crony, which is more than the average industrial worker could expect to earn in a year. This is not just a one off. This is a consistent practice of this Government.

The Taoiseach has two special advisers on salaries of €168,000 a year which is more than double the first point of the salary cap his Government set agus déanann siad é seo an fhad is atá ciorruithe millteanacha á ghearradh ar thuistí aonaracha, ar theaghlaigh agus ar dhaoine míchumasaithe. This is cronyism of the most blatant kind. It is hypocrisy. The Taoiseach does this while he imposes savage cuts on lone parents, the disabled and on families.

Under Fine Gael and the Labour Party’s watch, a former Secretary General received a golden handshake worth a whopping €713,000, including an annual pension of €142,000. Each time Sinn Féin questions the scandalously high pay and pension arrangements for the top people in the public sector, Ministers excuse it on the basis that they are worth it. Paying off failed senior civil servants with bumper pension pots and plum jobs in Europe is a scandal.

It is Fianna Fáil all over again — massive salaries to Ministers, special advisers, judges, hospital consultants and Secretaries General. However, it is clear none of the protected elites is worthy of such high pay at this time of economic crisis.

Under this Government’s watch the tax take is down, the cost of living is increasing, unemployment is rising and Fine Gael and the Labour Party have just extended the failed banking guarantee. On what planet does the Taoiseach think he is worth €200,000 a year? On planet Enda.

Could we have order please? Has the Leas-Cheann Comhairle spoken to the Taoiseach?


If the Taoiseach wants to table a debate on this in the Government’s time, I would be very happy to facilitate it. At the moment I want to talk about the Government’s budget but he does not want me to talk about that.


The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan’s, budget announced yesterday was a stealth tax budget. Of the €1 billion he raised, the massive bulk of it came from stealth charges — the VAT increase, the household charge, carbon tax, motor tax and excise duties. It was an anti-jobs budget. It is a pro-landlord and pro-property speculators budget.

The Government has protected property reliefs and allowed capital gains exemptions for people who buy commercial property and do not sell for seven years. This will encourage speculation if people do not have to pay capital gains tax on the profit of a property they sell. It protected the remaining section 23 reliefs rather than abolishing them, as the Labour Party had proposed. It will not go after the upward only rent reviews. Ní fhoghlaimíonn sibh aon rud.It is happy to forego tax coming into the Exchequer by amending these tax measures and to compensate for this, it cut child benefit, disability allowance and closed community nursing homes. Mo náire sibh.

The universal social charge is another unfair tax. Sinn Féin opposed it from the outset. The budget lifted those earning up to €10,000 out of the universal social charge but left all those earning up to the minimum wage still in it. Sinn Féin would have abolished this unfair charge. The Government kept one promise. It did not go after the high income earners. Tax rates and bands remain unchanged and those on high incomes are protected.

We know that indirect taxes hit the poorest hardest. That is a fact and the Taoiseach knows it. The decision to cut the fuel allowance by €120 is scandalous. This cut will hit older people and those with disabilities worst. This decision follows cuts of up to 25% to the fuel allowance and the household benefits package imposed by the Government in September and it comes at a time when fuel prices are increasing sharply. We know that 2,000 people, mostly elderly, die here every winter as a result of cold related illnesses.

The savage cut of €543 million in the health budget for 2012 will devastate the health services. When added to the existing HSE deficit the real level of cuts for 2012 will be over €850 million. Hospitals and other services across the State are under enormous pressure and these further attacks will only deepen the crisis.

The Government trumpets allocating €35 million to mental health services with one hand and then with the other strips €50 million from disability, mental health and children’s services, each of which are worthy causes. Mental health is the Cinderella of our health service. Will we develop a proper strategy for suicide prevention or self-harm when the Government is taking so much money out of those services?


The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, confirmed on Monday that more nursing homes will be closed in 2012. This is dreadful news for elderly people and their families as we approach Christmas. The way in which the Government has approached this issue has been sleekit. The names of 80 nursing homes which may be closed was leaked to the media, including two in my constituency of Louth, St. Joseph’s in Ardee and the Cottage in Drogheda.


However, two days after these cuts were announced, there is no certainty for these residents. This is no way to treat the elderly citizens of this State.

The cuts to the disability allowance payment from €188 to €100 for 18-21 year olds and €144 for 22-24 years olds are outrageous. They sparked anger and outrage among the public and scared Labour Party and Fine Gael backbenchers. In response to my question on one of these issues the Taoiseach mentioned that the social welfare Bill would not include the budget proposal, but it does. What sort of Advent is this?


The Taoiseach has stated the entire Cabinet took the decision and that the matter will be referred for review. I asked whether the Government equality proofs proposals. In response our resident clown, the Minister for whatever it is, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, stated——


——the Government did not have a machine through which to run the budget to equality proof it. However, €150,000 is allocated in the budget to the Department of Justice and Equality for equality proofing. What about joined-up, transparent and better government?






The Government may have paused the cuts, but it chooses to take money from the disabled. This is evidence of how far it has sunk and the Labour Party has strayed from its socialist and James Connolly roots.

The cuts to education amount to €316 million. The Taoiseach was waving bits of paper about, but this document tells us we need to know everything about the Government’s attitude towards education. The Tánaiste and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, gave an unqualified commitment to campaign against any new third level fees, if elected, including student fees, graduate taxes and a further increase in the student contribution. They stated: “We pledge to use our position in Dáil Éireann to protect the Higher Education Maintenance Grant from any and all cuts.” I will not read it all, as the pledge is available to everyone.


Increasing the student contribution fee by €250 will make higher education the preserve of the elite. I spoke to the Taoiseach about what constituted a republic. It is based on citizens who should have the right to access education at all levels.

The Government plans to cut guidance counselling services, which will have far-reaching consequences for young people who need support at school. The cuts mean that many students who require emotional and psychological support will have nowhere to turn to in a time of crisis, as the Taoiseach must know from his former career.


This is set against the alarming backdrop of increasing rates of suicide, self-harm and depression among the young. Added to this is the challenge faced by teachers who must deal with bullying in the classroom. Now more than ever we need guidance counselling services in schools.


This appalling decision under a Labour Party Minister makes a mockery of that party’s past commitment to ensuring young people attending school would have the proper supports available to them to reach their full potential.

In recent days the EU President, the French President and the German Chancellor have proposed wide-ranging changes to the EU treaty. They are not hiding behind anyone and have clearly set out their goal, that is, to control the budgets of member states. The Government refuses to share the Van Rompuy report with all the political parties in the Dáil — so much for transparency, a new way of working and political reform. It has refused my calls in recent days for an urgent debate before it discusses these vital matters in Brussels.


Sinn Féin fundamentally rejects any further loss of fiscal powers. We will oppose efforts to facilitate this and demand that, despite clear efforts by the EU leadership and the Government to avoid holding a referendum, citizens have their say. If the Government was clear on these issues and stood up for Irish interests, it would have spelled out its position, but its refusal to do so indicates that it will acquiesce to the diktat of the European superpowers and larger European states.


Their governments might be larger, but this does not mean they are right. We should not tug the forelock towards them.


In our debate last week the Taoiseach indicated his willingness to concede even greater fiscal sovereignty to the European Union. On Sunday night he stated he wanted to be the Taoiseach who returned Irish economic sovereignty.


He cannot be both or talk out of both sides of his mouth. The people deserve clear leadership.

There can be no recovery without job creation and an economic stimulus. Metro north, the DART interconnector and the N2-A5 road project have been cut. These vital projects would have created thousands of jobs and placed the economy in a strong place for recovery.



Ditto with the Government’s proposals for next generation broadband services. Sinn Féin would not cut capital spending.



Our capital investment proposals would significantly contribute to Ireland’s competitiveness, as well as developing a sustainable, performing economy. Investment in infrastructure not only benefits job creation in the immediate term, it also supplies side benefits for businesses and the State. For those who want to listen, we would fund these proposal from the remaining €5.3 billion in the NPRF and with €1.7 billion from the EIB. As the Taoiseach stated before the general election, we would not put money into criminally bad banks or pay unguaranteed bondholders.

Let me remark on one other aspect of bad policy and bad manners on the Government benches. The actions of Government backbenchers during the budget day speeches demonstrated the Government’s cynicism. Rather than listen to criticisms and constructive proposals from this side of the House, they heckle, harangue and shout down other Deputies. Ministers are generally listened to respectfully by Sinn Féin Members, no matter how provocative they may be, but Government Deputies, including, occasionally, the Taoiseach, find it difficult to contain themselves when Sinn Féin Deputies are speaking. The occasional witty intervention, even the odd heckle or spontaneous remark, may liven things up, but the concerted efforts to shout down, bully or silence a speaker are unacceptable.


There are repeat offenders, habitual serial shouters who have nothing of substance to say and there is no willingness to listen to what others might have to offer. It is little wonder George Lee left.


Sexism is alive and well in the Dáil, as was demonstrated clearly during Deputy Mary Lou McDonald’s response to the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reforem, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on Monday. She was interrupted 65 times during her 30 minute speech. One Fine Gael misogynist interrupted 27 times. These are not my figures; they were given to me by a Government Deputy with whom I spoke about this issue quietly. He had checked the figures.

Let me give the Government benches notice. Section 31, internment without trial, special courts, death squads — many members of my party have been killed in the North and County Donegal — heavy gangs, decades of vile propaganda, demonisation and revisionism did not silence Sinn Féin.


Be sure that a motley crew of bad mannered amadáin, lobby fodder for the Government, will not silence us. We have a mandate to be in this Chamber and will make our voices heard clearly. Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin beat me to it the other day when he told us that he had heard the North mentioned more often in the past nine months than he had at any other time in his 15 years in the Dáil. Sadly, this newfound interest springs from the desire to distract attention from the Government’s policies. It is not a concern for anyone in the Six Counties. Sometimes it is expressed as part of the general juvenile bubble that I have just spoken of, other times it comes from Ministers, including the Taoiseach, and usually the remarks are self-serving, inaccurate and incorrect. Such remarks diminish him and his office. The Taoiseach and Ministers know that the Executive in the North does not have fiscal autonomy. It cannot raise revenue through taxation and I would welcome the support of the Government parties for a campaign to take fiscal powers for the Executive from London to Belfast.


Maybe that is too much to ask. At a time when Sinn Féin in the North is attempting, with the active assistance of the DUP, to wrest such powers from London, Labour and the Fine Gael are preparing to give away fiscal powers to the EU. The Taoiseach knows that the cuts in the North come from the Tory budget and it demeans anyone here to use a British Tory Government’s cuts inflicted upon citizens in the Six Counties to distract attention from what we are trying to say and what the Government is doing. The Ministers in the North set themselves the task of protecting the most vulnerable and creating jobs. That is the task the Labour Party should have set itself if there is any rationale for Labour being in government. That is one of the many key differences between the Labour Party in this Government and Sinn Féin in the Executive. Among other positive measures by the Executive, Sinn Féin has blocked the introduction of water charges, invested more in infrastructure and education than previously in the history of the State and introduced free prescriptions. This Government has cut fuel allowance, cut child benefit, cut payments for lone parents, cut jobseeker’s allowance for part-time workers, cut €475 million out of local economies, cut the disability allowance and cut funding for North-South co-operation in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I could go on but I think the Government is aware of the hypocrisy and posturing on these matters. It is little wonder there is disappointment in people who tuned in hoping to hear solutions. We produced a pre-budget submission and I made sure it was sent to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. We were open to discussing it at any time. The Government did take in some of the small measures we advocated.

Does the Taoiseach remember the five-point plan? Our five-point plan is like a five pointed star, it gives light, clarity and direction. The Taoiseach has lost even that. This is a bad budget but it is his budget. It is the budget of Labour and Fine Gael, not the budget of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party is not here. This Government consciously made a choice to introduce the measures applied this week. This budget represents the worst of bad choices. If the Taoiseach makes the same bad political choices at the EU Summit, the consequences will be every bit as severe as the decisions made by the Taoiseach’s predecessors 90 years ago in other negotiations.

There can be no recovery without job creation and an economic stimulus. Metro north, the DART interconnector and the N2-A5 road project have been cut. These vital projects would have created thousands of jobs and placed the economy in a strong place for recovery.



Ditto with the Government’s proposals for next generation broadband services. Sinn Féin would not cut capital spending.



Our capital investment proposals would significantly contribute to Ireland’s competitiveness, as well as developing a sustainable, performing economy. Investment in infrastructure not only benefits job creation in the immediate term, it also supplies side benefits for businesses and the State. For those who want to listen, we would fund these proposal from the remaining €5.3 billion in the NPRF and with €1.7 billion from the EIB. As the Taoiseach stated before the general election, we would not put money into criminally bad banks or pay unguaranteed bondholders.

Let me remark on one other aspect of bad policy and bad manners on the Government benches. The actions of Government backbenchers during the budget day speeches demonstrated the Government’s cynicism. Rather than listen to criticisms and constructive proposals from this side of the House, they heckle, harangue and shout down other Deputies. Ministers are generally listened to respectfully by Sinn Féin Members, no matter how provocative they may be, but Government Deputies, including, occasionally, the Taoiseach, find it difficult to contain themselves when Sinn Féin Deputies are speaking. The occasional witty intervention, even the odd heckle or spontaneous remark, may liven things up, but the concerted efforts to shout down, bully or silence a speaker are unacceptable.


There are repeat offenders, habitual serial shouters who have nothing of substance to say and there is no willingness to listen to what others might have to offer. It is little wonder George Lee left.


Sexism is alive and well in the Dáil, as was demonstrated clearly during Deputy Mary Lou McDonald’s response to the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reforem, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on Monday. She was interrupted 65 times during her 30 minute speech. One Fine Gael misogynist interrupted 27 times. These are not my figures; they were given to me by a Government Deputy with whom I spoke about this issue quietly. He had checked the figures.

Let me give the Government benches notice. Section 31, internment without trial, special courts, death squads — many members of my party have been killed in the North and County Donegal — heavy gangs, decades of vile propaganda, demonisation and revisionism did not silence Sinn Féin.


Be sure that a motley crew of bad mannered amadáin, lobby fodder for the Government, will not silence us. We have a mandate to be in this Chamber and will make our voices heard clearly. Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin beat me to it the other day when he told us that he had heard the North mentioned more often in the past nine months than he had at any other time in his 15 years in the Dáil. Sadly, this newfound interest springs from the desire to distract attention from the Government’s policies. It is not a concern for anyone in the Six Counties. Sometimes it is expressed as part of the general juvenile bubble that I have just spoken of, other times it comes from Ministers, including the Taoiseach, and usually the remarks are self-serving, inaccurate and incorrect. Such remarks diminish him and his office. The Taoiseach and Ministers know that the Executive in the North does not have fiscal autonomy. It cannot raise revenue through taxation and I would welcome the support of the Government parties for a campaign to take fiscal powers for the Executive from London to Belfast.


Maybe that is too much to ask. At a time when Sinn Féin in the North is attempting, with the active assistance of the DUP, to wrest such powers from London, Labour and the Fine Gael are preparing to give away fiscal powers to the EU. The Taoiseach knows that the cuts in the North come from the Tory budget and it demeans anyone here to use a British Tory Government’s cuts inflicted upon citizens in the Six Counties to distract attention from what we are trying to say and what the Government is doing. The Ministers in the North set themselves the task of protecting the most vulnerable and creating jobs. That is the task the Labour Party should have set itself if there is any rationale for Labour being in government. That is one of the many key differences between the Labour Party in this Government and Sinn Féin in the Executive. Among other positive measures by the Executive, Sinn Féin has blocked the introduction of water charges, invested more in infrastructure and education than previously in the history of the State and introduced free prescriptions. This Government has cut fuel allowance, cut child benefit, cut payments for lone parents, cut jobseeker’s allowance for part-time workers, cut €475 million out of local economies, cut the disability allowance and cut funding for North-South co-operation in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I could go on but I think the Government is aware of the hypocrisy and posturing on these matters. It is little wonder there is disappointment in people who tuned in hoping to hear solutions. We produced a pre-budget submission and I made sure it was sent to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. We were open to discussing it at any time. The Government did take in some of the small measures we advocated.

Does the Taoiseach remember the five-point plan? Our five-point plan is like a five pointed star, it gives light, clarity and direction. The Taoiseach has lost even that. This is a bad budget but it is his budget. It is the budget of Labour and Fine Gael, not the budget of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party is not here. This Government consciously made a choice to introduce the measures applied this week. This budget represents the worst of bad choices. If the Taoiseach makes the same bad political choices at the EU Summit, the consequences will be every bit as severe as the decisions made by the Taoiseach’s predecessors 90 years ago in other negotiations.
