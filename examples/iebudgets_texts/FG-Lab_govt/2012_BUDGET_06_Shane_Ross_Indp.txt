There are elements of the budget which everybody in the House will welcome such as the universal social charge tax relief, income tax stability, research and development relief and mortgage interest relief, which mark a genuine effort by the Government to give some solace to people who are afflicted or vulnerable. I sometimes, but rarely, sympathise with the plight of the Government because, as it has stated regularly, with more than an element of truth, it has found itself in an economic hole which it is true it has inherited. The problem is that having landed in that hole, it seems to have taken to it and be as happy as a pig in the unmentionable commodity mentioned by Deputy Mattie McGrath in the House a short time ago.

The Government appears to have taken on the mantle of the conservative policies of Fianna Fáil and others and addressed it with relish. It seems that what Deputy Boyd Barrett has said is true, that the diktat is coming from elsewhere; it is not just coming from the Department of Finance, as is traditionally the case, or the last Government or the European Union. A series of strong, external forces are dictating internal policy to a degree that is totally unacceptable.

There are alternatives. While I do not agree with the one suggested by Deputy Boyd Barrett, there are several others. This is a conservative budget ad nauseam. A predecessor of the Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, said that when one was in a hole, one should stop digging. That is the policy the Taoiseach should have adopted. He should have addressed the issues in a far more radical way and not taken the old traditional routes which may — I do not believe they will — get us out of the hole to which he refers so frequently.

What is lacking in the budget more than anything is vision. I heard the Taoiseach say in his broadcast the other night that he wanted to see Ireland retrieve its sovereignty by 2015. It seems that is the last thing it will achieve in 2015 because this budget will take us on to a series of budgets which will lead us into what we will see agreed this weekend, a form of fiscal unity. We are going to be under the hammer of the troika for a few years, but we will then face fiscal unity which is, by definition, a sacrifice of economic sovereignty and independence. That is where we are headed, but let us not aspire to it but move directly in the opposite direction. What I would like to have heard from the Minister today was that he had a vision of where we would be when his series of budgets was completed in 2015 or 2016.

That is true because there was no vision. There was no idea of where we would be after two or three austerity budgets. What we do know is this: we know the budget deficit will be 3% of GDP and that we will still be in the eurozone, if the Minister gets his way. We also know — I agree with my friends on these benches on this point — that unemployment will still be at an unacceptable level. According to the Department of Finance’s forecasts, it will be at the level of 12% in 2015. What does that say about the Government’s jobs policy? It is hot air. Jobs will not be created by this budget, except in a tiny way. Everything being done in the budget and in other measures is peripheral. It makes a good impression. The impression the Minister gave today with this budget was very positive and very clever. All the good things were in front. Yesterday, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, produced a lot more of the negative things. When one actually examines them, the reality is that very few jobs will be created. The Department of Finance says that also, and its figures do not really take into account any flood of emigration which is almost certain to happen.

The vision we see here will include educational standards going down because of cuts in education and third level education not being open to everybody because of the measures introduced yesterday, but nevertheless the budget deficit will still be 3% of GDP and we will still be part of the euro. That really is an extraordinary aspiration. If the standard of living is to go down, unemployment is to go up and educational standards are to fall, we will still be able to say the budget deficit will be 3% of GDP.

I wonder whether it will be because one of the most significant things today — it was referred to by Deputy Pearse Doherty — was that the Minister very quietly demoted and reduced his predictions for growth next year. From being above 2% at one stage, it went down to 1.6% in October and to 1.3% today. That is a very high figure because the figure from the ESRI the other day was 0.9% and the figure from the OECD was 1%. The Department of Finance, for reasons which are difficult to explain, consistently produces optimistic figures on the growth side. That is obviously convenient if one is trying to sell and produce a budget of this sort but it means that somewhere down the line, in the next two or three budgets, the austerity will be greater again and greater than predicted.

This budget depends not only on growth rates which are much higher than this but on the continuing boom in exports. That is extraordinarily optimistic also. It is fair to say that the main outlets for our exports are either in recession or are heading for recession. The United Kingdom is undoubtedly heading for recession while the best prediction for the euro area is 0.3%. That is not a particularly optimistic outlet. Admittedly, the United States may expand in the next two years but the other main outlets for our exports are in recession. To hold out the prospect that somehow we as a nation will successfully and uniquely export to nations which are in recession is really living in economic cloud-cuckoo-land. That is the main difficulty with this budget. The growth figure is wildly optimistic and the export projections on which it is built are also wildly optimistic.

I do not believe we are heading for a situation in 2015 which the Minister could paint today. In reality, this budget takes us on a road to poverty, destitution and a standard of living which is unacceptable and which he could not spell out in his budget today because if he had done so, it would have been very difficult for the Labour Party backbenchers to accept.

There are measures which could have been taken. I do not wish to be negative but I do not understand what has happened to the apparent cull of the quangos. The rhetoric about the quangos before the election — I do not wish to score political points but this is very important — was extraordinarily strong, populist, realistic and practical. Does the Taoiseach remember the Fine Gael document, entitled Streamlining Government? I will not remind him of things which are embarrassing because I do not believe that is politics and it is not useful. However, it is useful to remind him of a few things in it. There was a determination and theme in it which talked about cutting costs. It talked about the 2,200 directors of quangos and about removing them. It also talked in fine rhetoric about Ireland having become the land of 1,000 quangos.

Now, in a great flurry, we are talking about a reduction of only 50. Some of those are merely mergers, not to mention the ones created. The reduction in the number of quangos will be minuscule. However, there are opportunities here, which I could outline to the Taoiseach and about which I have talked in the House, to reduce the number of quangos to under 100 and the number of directors of quangos to certainly well under current 2,200. That would at least be a symbol of the Taoiseach’s determination to cut out the waste in this budget.

This is conventional economics on a level which is depressing because it is leading us to a situation which will only make the fundamental economic indicators much worse than they were. There are no new big ideas in this budget and I am very depressed that it is happening in the same week the Taoiseach will go to Europe to sort out a much bigger problem.

I suggest the Taoiseach goes to Europe not overshadowed by Brussels, that he puts the fundamental problem behind this budget on the agenda, that is, the Irish debt, and that he looks for a write-off of the Irish debt. I want the Taoiseach to spoil the party. I do not want him to go to Europe and be some sort of lap-dog to the big powers. I want him to say he is Irish, we are in trouble, which they landed us in, and that he is going to spoil their party unless the write-off of the debt is not only on the agenda but is achieved. If that is done, this budget will, thankfully, be irrelevant and the Taoiseach will be able to come back next week and say the future is brighter and that he will produce a better budget for the Irish people.
