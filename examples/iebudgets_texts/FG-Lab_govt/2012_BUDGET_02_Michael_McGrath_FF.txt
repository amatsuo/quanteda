Today is not about the Government versus the Opposition. All of us have the privilege of being elected Members of Dáil Éireann and it is our duty to put the Irish people ahead of any narrow party political interests. I have no doubt we share the same fundamental objectives for this country — to bring about economic recovery, to improve the quality of life of our citizens and to give them hope during this dark economic period. It is our common purpose to make this country the best it can possibly be.

Today is the day Fine Gael and Labour accept the responsibility that comes with being in power. The Government can no longer hide behind the actions or decisions of the previous Government. When this Government came into office in March, the budget for the year had already been passed for them despite their trenchant opposition to it. Fine Gael and Labour had no major budgetary decisions to make until this week. From now on, they will be judged on the actions of the Government, their political choices and the result they bring for our people. Over the past two days, the Government has made known its political choices. Let us be clear that, difficult as the circumstances were, the Government had choices. It was working within the framework of the EU-IMF deal but, in the words of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, speaking at the end of the last quarterly review by the troika in October, “the troika made it clear that they had no difficulty in substituting one fiscal measure for another with an equal value”. Let there be no equivocation on this point. The decisions laid before this House yesterday and today are the decisions of Fine Gael and Labour and nobody else. The EU and IMF did not tell this Government to cut child benefit for third and subsequent children, the EU and IMF did not tell this Government to increase the drug payments scheme threshold to €132 per month for hard-pressed working families, the EU and IMF did not tell this Government to cut the fuel allowance to vulnerable, elderly people by six weeks——

——and the EU and IMF did not tell the Government to breach its self-imposed pay cap for special advisers to the tune of €35,000. These were political choices made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Fianna Fáil has committed itself to a positive approach to opposition. We will not oppose measures for the sake of it, nor have we done so. If we agree with what the Government is doing, we will support it. If we disagree, we will oppose it and put forward what we believe is a credible and realistic alternative. I regret that this was not the approach of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in opposition. Their approach was utterly cynical. Measures that were obviously necessary for this country were opposed tooth and nail by Fine Gael in opposition. Much of the Opposition rhetoric, not to mention reckless election promises, are now coming home to roost. While in opposition and during the election, Fine Gael and Labour gave the Irish people the distinct impression that there would be an easier and softer way of tackling our problems. Now that those parties have shown their hand, the Irish people have been left bitterly disappointed.

Various people who now sit around the Cabinet table have described this country as being banjaxed, as an economic corpse and as a country in a pawn shop. As a true republican party, we will not adopt such a negative, self-serving, corrosive style of opposition.

I know that Government Deputies would rather there were no Opposition Members in this House but there is an Opposition. We may be small in number but we will make our voices heard, increasingly so from now on. We will call it as we see it but we will never portray this country in a light that is unfair or that will undermine the efforts to improve life for our people. This is a great country going through an extraordinarily difficult period in its economic history but come through it, I have no doubt, we will. The Irish people have endured a great deal over the past three years. Successive budgets have forced more and more sacrifice on them and many people are struggling to get by on a day-to-day basis. People are worried about providing for their children today and what the future will bring those children tomorrow. High levels of unemployment and forced emigration have re-emerged as an unwelcome feature in every community across the country. Many families will spend this Christmas without loved ones, with young Irish men and women working as far away as Australia, the US and Canada. Their absence and their aspiration for a future here must be given expression in this House today.

Over the coming days, people will come to terms with the detail of the cuts and taxation measures announced yesterday and today. They will find many unpleasant surprises buried in the detail of the announcements that have been made, including social welfare rate cuts. For example, for pensions with less than an average of 48 weeks’ contributions per year — basically anyone who left the workforce for any period of time, including mothers who spent time at home to mind children — will now be deprived of a pension, as was made clear in the statement yesterday. Disgracefully, for widows, the Minister is increasing the number of years’ contributions——


The Government is increasing the number of years’ contributions required to qualify for a widow’s pension from three years to ten years. One parent family payment is also being cut by bringing the qualifying age of a child to seven. These are rate cuts; they can be dressed up whatever way the Government wants but they are what they are and the people will know it when they get their welfare payments.

The Government pretends that rates are being maintained but for many welfare claimants, weekly income will be substantially cut. In the cold light of day, and I hope the Minister reflects on this, there are some measures that should be reconsidered. The cuts the Minister is imposing on young people with disabilities are deeply unfair.


It is a heartless and cruel cut. Cutting up to €88 per week from young people going on disability allowance, some of whom have severe and profound disabilities, is totally unnecessary and should be reversed.

Young people with disabilities look forward to having an income of their own. They look forward to the independence it gives them and the quality of life it brings with it.

Last year the Minister rounded on Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in Government for imposing a cut on the blind pension and I believe he was right; it was the wrong thing to do.


What the Minister proposes today on cutting the disability allowance for young people up to the age of 24 is also the wrong thing to do and it should be reversed.

The Minister certainly has the backbenchers to drown us out, he has the numbers to bulldoze through whatever measures he wants; he does not need the support of Fianna Fáil or anyone else in Opposition but for the sake of the €7 million saved with this cut, he should have a second look.

In education, the changes announced will effectively mean some schools will no longer provide guidance counselling services for students. If they do, they will see an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio. At a time when young people are under huge pressure to perform in school and to conform with their peers, often the school guidance counsellor is the safety net that prevents a personal problem from escalating even further. With youth mental health and suicide a growing problem for our young people, this is a cut that could come at a high personal price for many.

Education is a core value of our party. As a country, given the direction our economy is heading, having a postgraduate qualification is becoming increasingly necessary for our graduates. The cuts planned in postgraduate education are socially regressive and economically counterproductive. These changes will mean in a great many cases that a son or daughter of a widow, a carer or someone from a low income family will no longer have the option of pursuing postgraduate education. This is not right. Education is a gateway to a better future, for individuals and for the country.

This cut, along with the further cut to student grants and the 20% cut to the fund for students with disabilities at third level——

——will save a miserly €15 million. Postgraduate education should not be the preserve of the wealthy and if the Minister goes ahead with these cuts, that is exactly what the outcome will be. When that information is placed alongside the report in today’s The Irish Times that there are 200 people in the third level sector earning €150,000 and more, with 100 of them earning more than €200,000, where is the fairness?


On coming into office nine months ago, this Government asked to be judged on its success in tackling the jobs crisis. If it succeeds, I and my party will be the first to congratulate it. The retention of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs must be the number one priority for all of us. We can all accept that making inroads into Ireland’s unemployment rate will help to solve so many other problems, as the Tánaiste so regularly pointed out in Opposition. It would reduce our social welfare bill, improve our income tax take and increase the disposable income households have. It would be the most painless way of reducing our budget deficit and getting our economy back on track.

On entering office, the Taoiseach promised a jobs budget within 100 days in Government. He delivered a jobs initiative in May that was funded by a raid on private pension savings. I regret that the initiative has so far failed to deliver.

The truth is that the number of people on the live register is 448,600 people, 7,300 more than the day the Government entered office.

The Government pointed to increased tourism numbers in 2011. There is evidence of that and we welcome it. That increase is compared to the exceptionally low base in 2010 and the signs of recovery in tourism were evident before the VAT reduction took effect in July.

Today’s budget fails to give any meaningful hope to those looking for a job. The Minister outlined some measures to give a boost to job creation, and we welcome those in so far as they go, particularly the changes for research and development. We included those in our budget submission. The Minister announced again the loan guarantee fund and the microfinance fund, along with some measures to companies that wish to export to the emerging economies. Those measures are welcome but they are limited. I expected enterprise, job creation and targeted initiatives would be at the centre of the budget and such measures are sadly lacking. There are no targets and there is no timetable for delivery and long gone is the talk of 100,000 new jobs. When I look at the detail of the document put before us today in the stability and growth update, net employment is expected to fall slightly next year by 0.2% with unemployment averaging 14.1% in 2012. The Government is effectively saying there will be no discernible improvement in the employment situation in 2012. That will be a major disappointment for many people looking for a job.

I am glad the Minister read our budget proposals on the universal social charge and the changes being introduced to exempt many part-time, casual and seasonal workers. That is a step in the right direction. I am sure Government backbenchers will agree that it is a modest change to a charge Fine Gael and Labour railed against from the Opposition benches last year. I am sure he will not seek to spin this change out of all proportion because the truth is that for anyone working full-time, it makes no difference, while for those earning less than €10,000 there can be a saving of up to €4 per week but that saving has been more than wiped out for anyone relying on any welfare benefit by the changes announced yesterday.

If we look at the combined effect of the changes announced yesterday and today, when we examine the figures closely, the people who will be hardest hit are working families with children and families dependent on welfare. If we take two examples we can see this. A working family with four children over the course of a year will lose €432 child benefit and while we can quibble about the exact amount, they will lose about €300 to €400 in VAT at least. On the drugs payment scheme they will pay an extra €144 and an extra €100 for the household charge. For motor tax, excise duty and carbon tax they will lose at a minimum another €100. If they are fortunate enough to have private health insurance, the VHI has said there will be a 50% increase in the premium arising from the measures announced yesterday. For a family of six people, a typical One Plus plan is about €2,000 so we can add another €1,000 for that. For such a working family irrespective of its income, the total cost of these budget measures is approximately €2,176. Let us take a second example of a family with three children aged three, eight and 14, where the parents paid income tax for years but where the principal earner lost his or her job at the start of the recession——

——and the family now relies on mortgage interest supplement to heat the family home. They will lose €228 on child benefit. They will lose €120 on fuel allowance. For the youngest child they will lose €200 on the back to school allowance and for the two older children they will lose €105 between them. With much less disposable income the VAT increase will cost them approximately €250 — I am sure the Department of Finance officials will not disagree with that. Motor taxation, carbon tax and excise duty increases will cost them a minimum of €100, which is a very conservative figure. Critically in their case, as a family relying on mortgage interest supplement, the Government imposed a savage cut yesterday, reducing the budget for mortgage interest supplement by approximately a third and increasing the minimum contribution from €24 per week to €35 per week. That will cost that family €572 in a year. That is €1,575 for a family entirely dependent on welfare. That is the net effect of the budget introduced yesterday and today. These are just two examples of families already hard hit by the recession.

It would be unrealistic for me or anyone else on this side of the House to think that those people and other families would be unaffected by the budget — we are not that naïve. The major flaw in this budget is that its impact is not progressive — in fact it is a highly regressive budget. It is also socially regressive because of the choices the Minister has made. The token 5% surcharge on income that is sheltered by the reliefs is a pretty poor compromise for the Labour Party to make given the way it made hay when sitting on the Opposition benches and calling for the immediate abolition of all the property-related tax reliefs. If that is all it managed to negotiate in government, it does not say much for its clout in government.


It is all very well to tell people it is not——

It is all very well to tell people the Government is not increasing their income tax and not cutting their basic welfare rates, but that is cold comfort to families already struggling to get by and they realise the impact the budget will have on them. These families will certainly not take the advice of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and book a holiday any time soon on the back of this budget.

The Government is not asking the very high earners in the economy to make any contribution bar a token gesture of 5% for those who are sheltering income with tax relief.

On the broader economic picture, the detail of today’s document again reveals that the Government has downgraded its growth forecast for 2012. It has only been approximately three weeks since it came out with the medium-term fiscal statement proclaiming that growth in the economy would be 1.6%. The Minister’s speech and the accompanying detailed document now state that growth is forecast to be 1.3%, which does not inspire much confidence. Three weeks after coming out with the much heralded four-year plan, the medium-term fiscal statement, the Government has already downgraded the growth forecast for 2012 to 1.3%. It is correct that 1.6% was almost certainly too optimistic and I sincerely hope the 1.3% growth it has now forecast is achieved and exceeded.

With each passing day since that announcement in November the Government’s forecast for growth looked increasingly optimistic and out of line with the views of a range of independent commentators. We all know that consumption in the domestic economy continues to contract — the Government’s stability and growth update forecasts that to continue in 2012. Consumer sentiment is weak and the extra money the budget will take out of people’s pockets will make matters worse. While we hope the ECB will further reduce interest rates later this week — which the Government should demand be passed on to personal and business customers — on all other fronts the omens for consumer confidence have deteriorated in recent months and 2012 will, at best, be another fragile year for the domestic economy.

Our exports reached record levels this year and have the potential to bring us back to significant economic growth. Multinational companies operating in Ireland and many Irish businesses have performed remarkably well in the export sector. However, the risks we face are stark. Our ambitions for an export-led recovery are now under serious threat from the ongoing eurozone debt and financial crisis and its impact across the globe. Our main trading partner, the UK, has dramatically downgraded its growth forecast for 2012 from 2.5% of GDP to 0.7%. The European Commission has downgraded its forecast for the eurozone economy for next year from 1.8% to 0.5%. Others predict that the eurozone could slip back into recession. In simple terms, if there is less demand among our main trading partners for the goods and services we produce, our exports will suffer and it will act as a drag on economic growth.

In its quarterly economic commentary, published last week the ESRI downgraded Ireland’s growth forecast to just 0.9% for next year and forecast a contraction in GNP. The OECD took a similar outlook at just 1%. I am glad the Minister has come to the realisation that 1.6% was an outlier and has come back into line somewhat with other forecasts for the Irish economy for 2012. It may still prove to be too optimistic, but I hope it does not.

The 9% increase in income tax receipts the Minister forecast for 2012 before he even stood up in the House today appears ambitious even taking into account the carry-over effect from last year’s budget on which he relies. As the Minister is well aware, the last three months’ Exchequer returns have shown a significant deterioration in tax receipts. In November alone those receipts were €337 million off target and the White Paper on expenditure and receipt shows that the full-year tax take is estimated to be €700 million below target. This is even after it is flattered by the mid-year raid on private pensions yielding approximately €460 million. The Minister has pointed out many times that for every 1% of economic growth that is not achieved, the impact on the Exchequer is approximately €800 million. If 1% is taken off the growth for next year, the impact on the Exchequer finances and the targets in this budget will be very clear indeed.

When the political commitments made by Fine Gael and Labour, and the 2012 budget strategy outlined yesterday and today are taken into account, it is clear the Government has left itself very little room for manoeuvre for its remaining four years in office. On the main four income headings, it has used all its headroom in VAT in the first year by front-loading the 2% increase and capping the rate at 23%. It has committed to no income tax increases over the lifetime of the Government, although I note that is somewhat diluted in the text of the Minister’s speech in which he commits to no income tax increases in 2012. However, we can only take him at his word that there will be no income tax increases over the lifetime of the Government. We all agree that the corporation tax rate should not be increased and we can also agree that there is a limit to the amount of excise that can be put on a litre of petrol or a pint of beer.

On the expenditure side, the Government has ruled out any reductions in welfare rates in the next four years’ budgets as well as yesterday’s even though it has slipped in a few by the backdoor. It appears to be committed to the Croke Park Agreement to 2014. Therefore it has left very little room on either the revenue or expenditure side should its growth forecasts prove to be too optimistic. Without question it has made the easier political choices in this budget. However, I am not so sure it will have the same luxury in the coming years. The sobering news for all the Government backbenchers is that far from this being the hardest budget the Government will need to introduce, it may well prove to have been the easiest.


Since coming to power the Government’s strategy has been to look for easy targets to raise tax revenue — ideally once it believes people will not notice. It raided private pensions for €460 million, but because people do not see it coming out of their disposable income the Government felt it would get away with it. It is now focusing on VAT, hoping people will not notice that either. The Minister may be trying to pass this off as simply an increase in tax on luxury items, but many everyday items on which families rely will increase in price as a result of this VAT increase, including such basic items as mobile and land line phone calls, adult clothing and footwear, car park charges, detergents, petrol, diesel, oil, prams, shampoo, soap and toothpaste, which are hardly luxury items.

When news of the VAT increase leaked in the German Bundestag the Minister was quick to put out his analysis that it would have a greater impact on the better off. However, the distribution effects of VAT in Ireland were examined by the ESRI in a paper published as recently as July. The results were unambiguous.

They showed that those hardest hit by a VAT increase are households in the lowest 10% income bracket, households in rural areas and one-parent families.

The Minister said a few months ago that what we need is for people to start buying again. I would have expected Government policy to underpin that objective. The Government has instead done the opposite.

A 2% increase in VAT is a mistake at this time. I accept it is included in the EU-IMF deal for 2013 and 2014 but the Government has chosen to front-load it at a time when the domestic economy is at its weakest. At a time when exports are facing a challenging environment, there was a need for positive emphasis on the domestic economy but the Government decided to do the opposite.

The Minister for Finance, in a reply to me last week, stated that the VAT increase would yield €670 million. I note that figure is again confirmed in the budget document.

Yes. The Minister also confirmed in that reply that such a projection takes no account whatsoever of any reduction in demand brought about by an increase in VAT. The Minister has many economists at his disposal in the Department of Finance. Surely one of them told him that if he increased prices, demand would reduce. A basic economic principle is price elasticity of demand. I am not going to exaggerate and say that this will result in a negative yield. Of course it will not. However, I do not believe this 2% increase in VAT will result in an additional €670 million to the Exchequer. I am shocked that the Department of Finance has allowed that to get through.


A little light relief is no harm on days such as this. We all welcome that.

Let us take one example. Car sales have gone into decline since the end of the scrappage scheme in June. Figures released on Friday by the motor industry show that car sales in November were down 50% on those for the same month last year. The 2% VAT increase will add €300 to the cost of an average family car. The State collects considerable revenue from car sales in terms of VAT and VRT. The Minister may find that not alone will VAT returns be depressed but other forms of tax such as VRT may suffer a knock-on effect as people adjust their spending patterns on the basis of this VAT increase.

We need to consider what will be the impact of the VAT change on customers in the Border region. I am not prone to exaggeration and will not suggest, as did many of the Minister’s colleagues when on this side of the House, that increasing VAT will send everyone over the Border to shop. However, I do listen to those close to the ground. For example, the Derry Chamber of Commerce is celebrating the Government’s decision to increase our VAT by 2%. It is adamant that this will result in more people going across the Border to shop. The Dundalk Chamber of Commerce also makes the same point. It believes its businesses will be hammered because of the VAT increase here. Where borderline decisions are to be made on purchases, people will go over the Border. Not alone will they purchase that particular item but they will do other shopping too, resulting in a loss to the Exchequer.

The Minister has often made the point that the euro-sterling exchange rate is also an influence on cross-Border shopping, which I accept. While that exchange rate may be favourable now, a weakness in the pattern of the exchange rate on the sterling side will have a major impact on us. A combination of the VAT increase and an adverse movement in the exchange rate could exacerbate the problem. The Minister is aware that VAT is way under profile. The latest Exchequer returns put it at €464 million compared with profile, which is not fully explained by the reduction in VAT announced in the jobs initiative.

The difference between what was said by Members of the Government parties when in Opposition and now when they are in government is incredible. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, for whom I have great respect, said in Opposition, in response to a 0.5% increase in VAT by the late Brian Lenihan: “The Minister has made decisions today that will threaten to turn a recession into a depression.” The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, who I regret is prone to exaggeration said: “the Minister is proposing to increase VAT by 0.5% to an astronomical 21.5% ... one of the highest rates in Europe”, which she said would send “shoppers scurrying over the Border to queue in ASDA in Enniskillen and Sainsburys in Newry.” I would love to know what she thinks about increasing VAT to 23%.

We believe the Government’s decision to impose a levy on private pension funds was deeply unfair. The Government is in effect raiding the private savings of Irish citizens. This measure runs contrary to the long-established principle of all Governments to encourage people to save prudently for their retirement. It was a sneaky levy. The Minister said it is a levy on the industry yet the Government voted down an amendment put forward by this side of the House which would have forced the industry to absorb the levy and not pass it on to pensioners by way of reduced benefits or to workers by way of increased contributions. The Government voted down that amendment.

The levy is being passed on to pensioners by way of benefit cuts. We have all heard the Tara Mines story. Many others will emerge in the weeks and months ahead. Existing workers are being asked to pay additional contributions to make up the shortfall. We know by way of freedom of information that this decision was made against the advice of the Pensions Board and officials and that the Minister for Social Protection wrote to the Minister advising against doing it.

I am highly sceptical of the Government’s promise to end the levy in four years time. I hope it sticks to its promise. We all know what happens to levies like this, namely, they become embedded in the system. The Exchequer becomes dependent on the revenue and the link which was so clear at the beginning between this levy and the funding of the jobs initiative will become blurred with the levy remaining in perpetuity. I hope I am wrong. Let us wait and see.

Fianna Fáil proposes that instead of imposing this levy the Government should put in place an investment stimulus of at least €5.6 billion over the next four years. The Government’s pension fund levy should be ended and replaced with a mandatory investment by pension funds of 4% over four years in the strategic investment fund announced by the Government in September.

This would be an investment of €700 million per annum and could be supplemented with an equivalent annual investment from the remaining discretionary portfolio in the National Pensions Reserve Fund. This would offer a long-term cashflow benefit to private pensions funds while stimulating economic activity and developing the infrastructure capacity of the State. Such a fund could also be open to regular savers, as in the case of the national solidarity bond.

I expected the Government to put enterprise and jobs at the centre of the budget announcements made yesterday and today. Sadly, I was disappointed. We must ensure that enterprise is at the heart of every Government decision. While we must continue to attract foreign direct investment, small and medium-sized Irish businesses will lead recovery in the Irish economy. We need to give them every possible assistance. We need an appeals mechanism based on economic circumstances to limit the burden of local authority rates. We need a significant enhancement of supports for small businesses. Fianna Fáil proposed in its pre-budget document a doubling of the modest budget available to city and county enterprise boards.

I believe that the Government should convene an economic advisory council to complement the work of the fiscal council. The economic advisory council should comprise a broad range of representatives from the private sector to advise Government on enterprise and wider economic policy. Membership of such a council could be drawn from key sectors of the economy, including SMEs, financial services and the export sector such as the agrifood industry. The steps taken since 2008 have resulted in a marked improvement in our competitiveness. The European Commission forecasts that by 2012 Ireland’s competitiveness will have improved by 14%, the largest in the European Union. This progress must be continued.

We need as a country to encourage and reward rather than penalise people in this country who take the risk of becoming self employed. As a means of encouraging entrepreneurship, the State should consider the introduction of a voluntary PRSI scheme for the self-employed so that, similar to other PAYE workers, when they lose their jobs they can claim jobseeker’s benefit and other welfare benefits. The current system is a deterrent to anyone thinking of starting a new business. The Minister has finally brought clarity to the issue of upward-only rent reviews, although not the clarity expected or promised to retailers. When upward-only rent reviews were ended for new leases, both the Labour Party and Fine Gael were absolutely adamant that there would be no problem with doing the same for existing leases. For nine months Members have been told the Minister for Justice and Equality is consulting the Attorney General. I had intended to ask how long did it take for the Attorney General to tell the Government whether a measure was constitutional.

Presumably, that answer has been given. Today the Government has raised the white flag on the issue of upward-only rent reviews. The uncertainty it allowed to develop in the past nine months created a vacuum in the commercial property sector.

Retailers did not know where they stood and investors were not able to make investment decisions because they had no solid basis for calculating a rental yield. This was the legacy of the Government’s decision on this measure for nine months——


——while failing to come up with a decision.


I am glad the Government has finally made a decision because that is what I had intended to ask the Minister to do today.


I had intended to ask the Minister to end the uncertainty and draw a line under the issue one way or another because this is what retailers and those who invest in property have been seeking for months. The line has been drawn under it, but it also has been drawn firmly under another broken promise by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.


On the €100 household charge, the Bill has been published by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan. However, it raises more questions than answers. In the detail of the document accompanying the Minister for Finance’s statement today, I note the site valuation-based tax is now not proposed to come into effect until 2014. Consequently, it appears as though a flat rate tax will be levied on households for at least two years and the Government’s capacity to deliver on this measure within that period remains to be seen. People really want to know where this charge is headed. Does the Government plan to increase it next year? I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that it is not fair or equitable to have in place a flat rate tax over a prolonged period, whereby someone living on Ailesbury Road will pay the same charge as someone living in a two bedroom apartment in Dublin city centre who is in negative equity of €200,000. The level of exemptions and waivers set out in the aforementioned legislation is miserly. The Government is also asking widows, carers, the disabled, pensioners, those in mortgage arrears and negative equity to pay this household charge.

Amendments will be tabled and Members will find out how the Government reacts to them.

How much time remains?


I have a lot more to say.


I will be brief.


This is a socially regressive budget. Its impact will be felt hardest by low and middle income families with children, young people with disabilities, vulnerable elderly people and students trying to chart a better future. The Government had the option of closing loopholes, a measure that was promised, and targeting higher income earners. Instead, it has played its trump card by increasing VAT in the first year of its five year life. This is despite the clear evidence of the weakness of the domestic economy. The tens of thousands of families in mortgage arrears will find nothing in today’s announcement that will help them. People outside medical card guidelines who take out medical insurance will be hit with massive premium increases. The 448,600 people on the live register are being told that unemployment will increase.

The real flaw in this budget is its inherent lack of fairness. The people know cuts must be made and that taxes must be increased and are willing to accept them if they are fair. Unfortunately, as the measures announced today and yesterday are rolled out in the weeks ahead, that basic test of fairness will not be achieved. The real measure of this budget and the Government’s economic strategy will be whether real inroads are made in the months ahead in reducing unemployment. I am sure all Deputies, despite their differences, can agree on that much.

Today is not about the Government versus the Opposition. All of us have the privilege of being elected Members of Dáil Éireann and it is our duty to put the Irish people ahead of any narrow party political interests. I have no doubt we share the same fundamental objectives for this country — to bring about economic recovery, to improve the quality of life of our citizens and to give them hope during this dark economic period. It is our common purpose to make this country the best it can possibly be.

Today is the day Fine Gael and Labour accept the responsibility that comes with being in power. The Government can no longer hide behind the actions or decisions of the previous Government. When this Government came into office in March, the budget for the year had already been passed for them despite their trenchant opposition to it. Fine Gael and Labour had no major budgetary decisions to make until this week. From now on, they will be judged on the actions of the Government, their political choices and the result they bring for our people. Over the past two days, the Government has made known its political choices. Let us be clear that, difficult as the circumstances were, the Government had choices. It was working within the framework of the EU-IMF deal but, in the words of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, speaking at the end of the last quarterly review by the troika in October, “the troika made it clear that they had no difficulty in substituting one fiscal measure for another with an equal value”. Let there be no equivocation on this point. The decisions laid before this House yesterday and today are the decisions of Fine Gael and Labour and nobody else. The EU and IMF did not tell this Government to cut child benefit for third and subsequent children, the EU and IMF did not tell this Government to increase the drug payments scheme threshold to €132 per month for hard-pressed working families, the EU and IMF did not tell this Government to cut the fuel allowance to vulnerable, elderly people by six weeks——

——and the EU and IMF did not tell the Government to breach its self-imposed pay cap for special advisers to the tune of €35,000. These were political choices made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Fianna Fáil has committed itself to a positive approach to opposition. We will not oppose measures for the sake of it, nor have we done so. If we agree with what the Government is doing, we will support it. If we disagree, we will oppose it and put forward what we believe is a credible and realistic alternative. I regret that this was not the approach of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in opposition. Their approach was utterly cynical. Measures that were obviously necessary for this country were opposed tooth and nail by Fine Gael in opposition. Much of the Opposition rhetoric, not to mention reckless election promises, are now coming home to roost. While in opposition and during the election, Fine Gael and Labour gave the Irish people the distinct impression that there would be an easier and softer way of tackling our problems. Now that those parties have shown their hand, the Irish people have been left bitterly disappointed.

Various people who now sit around the Cabinet table have described this country as being banjaxed, as an economic corpse and as a country in a pawn shop. As a true republican party, we will not adopt such a negative, self-serving, corrosive style of opposition.

I know that Government Deputies would rather there were no Opposition Members in this House but there is an Opposition. We may be small in number but we will make our voices heard, increasingly so from now on. We will call it as we see it but we will never portray this country in a light that is unfair or that will undermine the efforts to improve life for our people. This is a great country going through an extraordinarily difficult period in its economic history but come through it, I have no doubt, we will. The Irish people have endured a great deal over the past three years. Successive budgets have forced more and more sacrifice on them and many people are struggling to get by on a day-to-day basis. People are worried about providing for their children today and what the future will bring those children tomorrow. High levels of unemployment and forced emigration have re-emerged as an unwelcome feature in every community across the country. Many families will spend this Christmas without loved ones, with young Irish men and women working as far away as Australia, the US and Canada. Their absence and their aspiration for a future here must be given expression in this House today.

Over the coming days, people will come to terms with the detail of the cuts and taxation measures announced yesterday and today. They will find many unpleasant surprises buried in the detail of the announcements that have been made, including social welfare rate cuts. For example, for pensions with less than an average of 48 weeks’ contributions per year — basically anyone who left the workforce for any period of time, including mothers who spent time at home to mind children — will now be deprived of a pension, as was made clear in the statement yesterday. Disgracefully, for widows, the Minister is increasing the number of years’ contributions——


The Government is increasing the number of years’ contributions required to qualify for a widow’s pension from three years to ten years. One parent family payment is also being cut by bringing the qualifying age of a child to seven. These are rate cuts; they can be dressed up whatever way the Government wants but they are what they are and the people will know it when they get their welfare payments.

The Government pretends that rates are being maintained but for many welfare claimants, weekly income will be substantially cut. In the cold light of day, and I hope the Minister reflects on this, there are some measures that should be reconsidered. The cuts the Minister is imposing on young people with disabilities are deeply unfair.


It is a heartless and cruel cut. Cutting up to €88 per week from young people going on disability allowance, some of whom have severe and profound disabilities, is totally unnecessary and should be reversed.

Young people with disabilities look forward to having an income of their own. They look forward to the independence it gives them and the quality of life it brings with it.

Last year the Minister rounded on Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in Government for imposing a cut on the blind pension and I believe he was right; it was the wrong thing to do.


What the Minister proposes today on cutting the disability allowance for young people up to the age of 24 is also the wrong thing to do and it should be reversed.

The Minister certainly has the backbenchers to drown us out, he has the numbers to bulldoze through whatever measures he wants; he does not need the support of Fianna Fáil or anyone else in Opposition but for the sake of the €7 million saved with this cut, he should have a second look.

In education, the changes announced will effectively mean some schools will no longer provide guidance counselling services for students. If they do, they will see an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio. At a time when young people are under huge pressure to perform in school and to conform with their peers, often the school guidance counsellor is the safety net that prevents a personal problem from escalating even further. With youth mental health and suicide a growing problem for our young people, this is a cut that could come at a high personal price for many.

Education is a core value of our party. As a country, given the direction our economy is heading, having a postgraduate qualification is becoming increasingly necessary for our graduates. The cuts planned in postgraduate education are socially regressive and economically counterproductive. These changes will mean in a great many cases that a son or daughter of a widow, a carer or someone from a low income family will no longer have the option of pursuing postgraduate education. This is not right. Education is a gateway to a better future, for individuals and for the country.

This cut, along with the further cut to student grants and the 20% cut to the fund for students with disabilities at third level——

——will save a miserly €15 million. Postgraduate education should not be the preserve of the wealthy and if the Minister goes ahead with these cuts, that is exactly what the outcome will be. When that information is placed alongside the report in today’s The Irish Times that there are 200 people in the third level sector earning €150,000 and more, with 100 of them earning more than €200,000, where is the fairness?


On coming into office nine months ago, this Government asked to be judged on its success in tackling the jobs crisis. If it succeeds, I and my party will be the first to congratulate it. The retention of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs must be the number one priority for all of us. We can all accept that making inroads into Ireland’s unemployment rate will help to solve so many other problems, as the Tánaiste so regularly pointed out in Opposition. It would reduce our social welfare bill, improve our income tax take and increase the disposable income households have. It would be the most painless way of reducing our budget deficit and getting our economy back on track.

On entering office, the Taoiseach promised a jobs budget within 100 days in Government. He delivered a jobs initiative in May that was funded by a raid on private pension savings. I regret that the initiative has so far failed to deliver.

The truth is that the number of people on the live register is 448,600 people, 7,300 more than the day the Government entered office.

The Government pointed to increased tourism numbers in 2011. There is evidence of that and we welcome it. That increase is compared to the exceptionally low base in 2010 and the signs of recovery in tourism were evident before the VAT reduction took effect in July.

Today’s budget fails to give any meaningful hope to those looking for a job. The Minister outlined some measures to give a boost to job creation, and we welcome those in so far as they go, particularly the changes for research and development. We included those in our budget submission. The Minister announced again the loan guarantee fund and the microfinance fund, along with some measures to companies that wish to export to the emerging economies. Those measures are welcome but they are limited. I expected enterprise, job creation and targeted initiatives would be at the centre of the budget and such measures are sadly lacking. There are no targets and there is no timetable for delivery and long gone is the talk of 100,000 new jobs. When I look at the detail of the document put before us today in the stability and growth update, net employment is expected to fall slightly next year by 0.2% with unemployment averaging 14.1% in 2012. The Government is effectively saying there will be no discernible improvement in the employment situation in 2012. That will be a major disappointment for many people looking for a job.

I am glad the Minister read our budget proposals on the universal social charge and the changes being introduced to exempt many part-time, casual and seasonal workers. That is a step in the right direction. I am sure Government backbenchers will agree that it is a modest change to a charge Fine Gael and Labour railed against from the Opposition benches last year. I am sure he will not seek to spin this change out of all proportion because the truth is that for anyone working full-time, it makes no difference, while for those earning less than €10,000 there can be a saving of up to €4 per week but that saving has been more than wiped out for anyone relying on any welfare benefit by the changes announced yesterday.

If we look at the combined effect of the changes announced yesterday and today, when we examine the figures closely, the people who will be hardest hit are working families with children and families dependent on welfare. If we take two examples we can see this. A working family with four children over the course of a year will lose €432 child benefit and while we can quibble about the exact amount, they will lose about €300 to €400 in VAT at least. On the drugs payment scheme they will pay an extra €144 and an extra €100 for the household charge. For motor tax, excise duty and carbon tax they will lose at a minimum another €100. If they are fortunate enough to have private health insurance, the VHI has said there will be a 50% increase in the premium arising from the measures announced yesterday. For a family of six people, a typical One Plus plan is about €2,000 so we can add another €1,000 for that. For such a working family irrespective of its income, the total cost of these budget measures is approximately €2,176. Let us take a second example of a family with three children aged three, eight and 14, where the parents paid income tax for years but where the principal earner lost his or her job at the start of the recession——

——and the family now relies on mortgage interest supplement to heat the family home. They will lose €228 on child benefit. They will lose €120 on fuel allowance. For the youngest child they will lose €200 on the back to school allowance and for the two older children they will lose €105 between them. With much less disposable income the VAT increase will cost them approximately €250 — I am sure the Department of Finance officials will not disagree with that. Motor taxation, carbon tax and excise duty increases will cost them a minimum of €100, which is a very conservative figure. Critically in their case, as a family relying on mortgage interest supplement, the Government imposed a savage cut yesterday, reducing the budget for mortgage interest supplement by approximately a third and increasing the minimum contribution from €24 per week to €35 per week. That will cost that family €572 in a year. That is €1,575 for a family entirely dependent on welfare. That is the net effect of the budget introduced yesterday and today. These are just two examples of families already hard hit by the recession.

It would be unrealistic for me or anyone else on this side of the House to think that those people and other families would be unaffected by the budget — we are not that naïve. The major flaw in this budget is that its impact is not progressive — in fact it is a highly regressive budget. It is also socially regressive because of the choices the Minister has made. The token 5% surcharge on income that is sheltered by the reliefs is a pretty poor compromise for the Labour Party to make given the way it made hay when sitting on the Opposition benches and calling for the immediate abolition of all the property-related tax reliefs. If that is all it managed to negotiate in government, it does not say much for its clout in government.


It is all very well to tell people it is not——

It is all very well to tell people the Government is not increasing their income tax and not cutting their basic welfare rates, but that is cold comfort to families already struggling to get by and they realise the impact the budget will have on them. These families will certainly not take the advice of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, and book a holiday any time soon on the back of this budget.

The Government is not asking the very high earners in the economy to make any contribution bar a token gesture of 5% for those who are sheltering income with tax relief.

On the broader economic picture, the detail of today’s document again reveals that the Government has downgraded its growth forecast for 2012. It has only been approximately three weeks since it came out with the medium-term fiscal statement proclaiming that growth in the economy would be 1.6%. The Minister’s speech and the accompanying detailed document now state that growth is forecast to be 1.3%, which does not inspire much confidence. Three weeks after coming out with the much heralded four-year plan, the medium-term fiscal statement, the Government has already downgraded the growth forecast for 2012 to 1.3%. It is correct that 1.6% was almost certainly too optimistic and I sincerely hope the 1.3% growth it has now forecast is achieved and exceeded.

With each passing day since that announcement in November the Government’s forecast for growth looked increasingly optimistic and out of line with the views of a range of independent commentators. We all know that consumption in the domestic economy continues to contract — the Government’s stability and growth update forecasts that to continue in 2012. Consumer sentiment is weak and the extra money the budget will take out of people’s pockets will make matters worse. While we hope the ECB will further reduce interest rates later this week — which the Government should demand be passed on to personal and business customers — on all other fronts the omens for consumer confidence have deteriorated in recent months and 2012 will, at best, be another fragile year for the domestic economy.

Our exports reached record levels this year and have the potential to bring us back to significant economic growth. Multinational companies operating in Ireland and many Irish businesses have performed remarkably well in the export sector. However, the risks we face are stark. Our ambitions for an export-led recovery are now under serious threat from the ongoing eurozone debt and financial crisis and its impact across the globe. Our main trading partner, the UK, has dramatically downgraded its growth forecast for 2012 from 2.5% of GDP to 0.7%. The European Commission has downgraded its forecast for the eurozone economy for next year from 1.8% to 0.5%. Others predict that the eurozone could slip back into recession. In simple terms, if there is less demand among our main trading partners for the goods and services we produce, our exports will suffer and it will act as a drag on economic growth.

In its quarterly economic commentary, published last week the ESRI downgraded Ireland’s growth forecast to just 0.9% for next year and forecast a contraction in GNP. The OECD took a similar outlook at just 1%. I am glad the Minister has come to the realisation that 1.6% was an outlier and has come back into line somewhat with other forecasts for the Irish economy for 2012. It may still prove to be too optimistic, but I hope it does not.

The 9% increase in income tax receipts the Minister forecast for 2012 before he even stood up in the House today appears ambitious even taking into account the carry-over effect from last year’s budget on which he relies. As the Minister is well aware, the last three months’ Exchequer returns have shown a significant deterioration in tax receipts. In November alone those receipts were €337 million off target and the White Paper on expenditure and receipt shows that the full-year tax take is estimated to be €700 million below target. This is even after it is flattered by the mid-year raid on private pensions yielding approximately €460 million. The Minister has pointed out many times that for every 1% of economic growth that is not achieved, the impact on the Exchequer is approximately €800 million. If 1% is taken off the growth for next year, the impact on the Exchequer finances and the targets in this budget will be very clear indeed.

When the political commitments made by Fine Gael and Labour, and the 2012 budget strategy outlined yesterday and today are taken into account, it is clear the Government has left itself very little room for manoeuvre for its remaining four years in office. On the main four income headings, it has used all its headroom in VAT in the first year by front-loading the 2% increase and capping the rate at 23%. It has committed to no income tax increases over the lifetime of the Government, although I note that is somewhat diluted in the text of the Minister’s speech in which he commits to no income tax increases in 2012. However, we can only take him at his word that there will be no income tax increases over the lifetime of the Government. We all agree that the corporation tax rate should not be increased and we can also agree that there is a limit to the amount of excise that can be put on a litre of petrol or a pint of beer.

On the expenditure side, the Government has ruled out any reductions in welfare rates in the next four years’ budgets as well as yesterday’s even though it has slipped in a few by the backdoor. It appears to be committed to the Croke Park Agreement to 2014. Therefore it has left very little room on either the revenue or expenditure side should its growth forecasts prove to be too optimistic. Without question it has made the easier political choices in this budget. However, I am not so sure it will have the same luxury in the coming years. The sobering news for all the Government backbenchers is that far from this being the hardest budget the Government will need to introduce, it may well prove to have been the easiest.


Since coming to power the Government’s strategy has been to look for easy targets to raise tax revenue — ideally once it believes people will not notice. It raided private pensions for €460 million, but because people do not see it coming out of their disposable income the Government felt it would get away with it. It is now focusing on VAT, hoping people will not notice that either. The Minister may be trying to pass this off as simply an increase in tax on luxury items, but many everyday items on which families rely will increase in price as a result of this VAT increase, including such basic items as mobile and land line phone calls, adult clothing and footwear, car park charges, detergents, petrol, diesel, oil, prams, shampoo, soap and toothpaste, which are hardly luxury items.

When news of the VAT increase leaked in the German Bundestag the Minister was quick to put out his analysis that it would have a greater impact on the better off. However, the distribution effects of VAT in Ireland were examined by the ESRI in a paper published as recently as July. The results were unambiguous.

They showed that those hardest hit by a VAT increase are households in the lowest 10% income bracket, households in rural areas and one-parent families.

The Minister said a few months ago that what we need is for people to start buying again. I would have expected Government policy to underpin that objective. The Government has instead done the opposite.

A 2% increase in VAT is a mistake at this time. I accept it is included in the EU-IMF deal for 2013 and 2014 but the Government has chosen to front-load it at a time when the domestic economy is at its weakest. At a time when exports are facing a challenging environment, there was a need for positive emphasis on the domestic economy but the Government decided to do the opposite.

The Minister for Finance, in a reply to me last week, stated that the VAT increase would yield €670 million. I note that figure is again confirmed in the budget document.

Yes. The Minister also confirmed in that reply that such a projection takes no account whatsoever of any reduction in demand brought about by an increase in VAT. The Minister has many economists at his disposal in the Department of Finance. Surely one of them told him that if he increased prices, demand would reduce. A basic economic principle is price elasticity of demand. I am not going to exaggerate and say that this will result in a negative yield. Of course it will not. However, I do not believe this 2% increase in VAT will result in an additional €670 million to the Exchequer. I am shocked that the Department of Finance has allowed that to get through.


A little light relief is no harm on days such as this. We all welcome that.

Let us take one example. Car sales have gone into decline since the end of the scrappage scheme in June. Figures released on Friday by the motor industry show that car sales in November were down 50% on those for the same month last year. The 2% VAT increase will add €300 to the cost of an average family car. The State collects considerable revenue from car sales in terms of VAT and VRT. The Minister may find that not alone will VAT returns be depressed but other forms of tax such as VRT may suffer a knock-on effect as people adjust their spending patterns on the basis of this VAT increase.

We need to consider what will be the impact of the VAT change on customers in the Border region. I am not prone to exaggeration and will not suggest, as did many of the Minister’s colleagues when on this side of the House, that increasing VAT will send everyone over the Border to shop. However, I do listen to those close to the ground. For example, the Derry Chamber of Commerce is celebrating the Government’s decision to increase our VAT by 2%. It is adamant that this will result in more people going across the Border to shop. The Dundalk Chamber of Commerce also makes the same point. It believes its businesses will be hammered because of the VAT increase here. Where borderline decisions are to be made on purchases, people will go over the Border. Not alone will they purchase that particular item but they will do other shopping too, resulting in a loss to the Exchequer.

The Minister has often made the point that the euro-sterling exchange rate is also an influence on cross-Border shopping, which I accept. While that exchange rate may be favourable now, a weakness in the pattern of the exchange rate on the sterling side will have a major impact on us. A combination of the VAT increase and an adverse movement in the exchange rate could exacerbate the problem. The Minister is aware that VAT is way under profile. The latest Exchequer returns put it at €464 million compared with profile, which is not fully explained by the reduction in VAT announced in the jobs initiative.

The difference between what was said by Members of the Government parties when in Opposition and now when they are in government is incredible. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, for whom I have great respect, said in Opposition, in response to a 0.5% increase in VAT by the late Brian Lenihan: “The Minister has made decisions today that will threaten to turn a recession into a depression.” The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, who I regret is prone to exaggeration said: “the Minister is proposing to increase VAT by 0.5% to an astronomical 21.5% ... one of the highest rates in Europe”, which she said would send “shoppers scurrying over the Border to queue in ASDA in Enniskillen and Sainsburys in Newry.” I would love to know what she thinks about increasing VAT to 23%.

We believe the Government’s decision to impose a levy on private pension funds was deeply unfair. The Government is in effect raiding the private savings of Irish citizens. This measure runs contrary to the long-established principle of all Governments to encourage people to save prudently for their retirement. It was a sneaky levy. The Minister said it is a levy on the industry yet the Government voted down an amendment put forward by this side of the House which would have forced the industry to absorb the levy and not pass it on to pensioners by way of reduced benefits or to workers by way of increased contributions. The Government voted down that amendment.

The levy is being passed on to pensioners by way of benefit cuts. We have all heard the Tara Mines story. Many others will emerge in the weeks and months ahead. Existing workers are being asked to pay additional contributions to make up the shortfall. We know by way of freedom of information that this decision was made against the advice of the Pensions Board and officials and that the Minister for Social Protection wrote to the Minister advising against doing it.

I am highly sceptical of the Government’s promise to end the levy in four years time. I hope it sticks to its promise. We all know what happens to levies like this, namely, they become embedded in the system. The Exchequer becomes dependent on the revenue and the link which was so clear at the beginning between this levy and the funding of the jobs initiative will become blurred with the levy remaining in perpetuity. I hope I am wrong. Let us wait and see.

Fianna Fáil proposes that instead of imposing this levy the Government should put in place an investment stimulus of at least €5.6 billion over the next four years. The Government’s pension fund levy should be ended and replaced with a mandatory investment by pension funds of 4% over four years in the strategic investment fund announced by the Government in September.

This would be an investment of €700 million per annum and could be supplemented with an equivalent annual investment from the remaining discretionary portfolio in the National Pensions Reserve Fund. This would offer a long-term cashflow benefit to private pensions funds while stimulating economic activity and developing the infrastructure capacity of the State. Such a fund could also be open to regular savers, as in the case of the national solidarity bond.

I expected the Government to put enterprise and jobs at the centre of the budget announcements made yesterday and today. Sadly, I was disappointed. We must ensure that enterprise is at the heart of every Government decision. While we must continue to attract foreign direct investment, small and medium-sized Irish businesses will lead recovery in the Irish economy. We need to give them every possible assistance. We need an appeals mechanism based on economic circumstances to limit the burden of local authority rates. We need a significant enhancement of supports for small businesses. Fianna Fáil proposed in its pre-budget document a doubling of the modest budget available to city and county enterprise boards.

I believe that the Government should convene an economic advisory council to complement the work of the fiscal council. The economic advisory council should comprise a broad range of representatives from the private sector to advise Government on enterprise and wider economic policy. Membership of such a council could be drawn from key sectors of the economy, including SMEs, financial services and the export sector such as the agrifood industry. The steps taken since 2008 have resulted in a marked improvement in our competitiveness. The European Commission forecasts that by 2012 Ireland’s competitiveness will have improved by 14%, the largest in the European Union. This progress must be continued.

We need as a country to encourage and reward rather than penalise people in this country who take the risk of becoming self employed. As a means of encouraging entrepreneurship, the State should consider the introduction of a voluntary PRSI scheme for the self-employed so that, similar to other PAYE workers, when they lose their jobs they can claim jobseeker’s benefit and other welfare benefits. The current system is a deterrent to anyone thinking of starting a new business. The Minister has finally brought clarity to the issue of upward-only rent reviews, although not the clarity expected or promised to retailers. When upward-only rent reviews were ended for new leases, both the Labour Party and Fine Gael were absolutely adamant that there would be no problem with doing the same for existing leases. For nine months Members have been told the Minister for Justice and Equality is consulting the Attorney General. I had intended to ask how long did it take for the Attorney General to tell the Government whether a measure was constitutional.

Presumably, that answer has been given. Today the Government has raised the white flag on the issue of upward-only rent reviews. The uncertainty it allowed to develop in the past nine months created a vacuum in the commercial property sector.

Retailers did not know where they stood and investors were not able to make investment decisions because they had no solid basis for calculating a rental yield. This was the legacy of the Government’s decision on this measure for nine months——


——while failing to come up with a decision.


I am glad the Government has finally made a decision because that is what I had intended to ask the Minister to do today.


I had intended to ask the Minister to end the uncertainty and draw a line under the issue one way or another because this is what retailers and those who invest in property have been seeking for months. The line has been drawn under it, but it also has been drawn firmly under another broken promise by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.


On the €100 household charge, the Bill has been published by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan. However, it raises more questions than answers. In the detail of the document accompanying the Minister for Finance’s statement today, I note the site valuation-based tax is now not proposed to come into effect until 2014. Consequently, it appears as though a flat rate tax will be levied on households for at least two years and the Government’s capacity to deliver on this measure within that period remains to be seen. People really want to know where this charge is headed. Does the Government plan to increase it next year? I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that it is not fair or equitable to have in place a flat rate tax over a prolonged period, whereby someone living on Ailesbury Road will pay the same charge as someone living in a two bedroom apartment in Dublin city centre who is in negative equity of €200,000. The level of exemptions and waivers set out in the aforementioned legislation is miserly. The Government is also asking widows, carers, the disabled, pensioners, those in mortgage arrears and negative equity to pay this household charge.

Amendments will be tabled and Members will find out how the Government reacts to them.

How much time remains?


I have a lot more to say.


I will be brief.


This is a socially regressive budget. Its impact will be felt hardest by low and middle income families with children, young people with disabilities, vulnerable elderly people and students trying to chart a better future. The Government had the option of closing loopholes, a measure that was promised, and targeting higher income earners. Instead, it has played its trump card by increasing VAT in the first year of its five year life. This is despite the clear evidence of the weakness of the domestic economy. The tens of thousands of families in mortgage arrears will find nothing in today’s announcement that will help them. People outside medical card guidelines who take out medical insurance will be hit with massive premium increases. The 448,600 people on the live register are being told that unemployment will increase.

The real flaw in this budget is its inherent lack of fairness. The people know cuts must be made and that taxes must be increased and are willing to accept them if they are fair. Unfortunately, as the measures announced today and yesterday are rolled out in the weeks ahead, that basic test of fairness will not be achieved. The real measure of this budget and the Government’s economic strategy will be whether real inroads are made in the months ahead in reducing unemployment. I am sure all Deputies, despite their differences, can agree on that much.
