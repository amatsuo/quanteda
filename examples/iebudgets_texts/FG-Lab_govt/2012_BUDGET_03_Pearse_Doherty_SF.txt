Last February a huge majority of the electorate voted for change. They voted for an end to the failed policies of Fianna Fáil and the politics of the Green Party. They voted for a new approach to the economy, unemployment, the banks, public services and political reform. Moreover, they voted for an end to political cronyism. They wanted change, fairness and equality. Most of all, they want hope tomorrow will be better than yesterday.

In the nine months since Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office, they have broken promise after promise. They have slowly but steadily dashed the hopes of the people who put their faith in them. Across the State, despite the litany of broken promises, people were still holding out for good news. They still were yearning for hope the Government’s budget announcements this week would make tomorrow better than yesterday. While I have no desire to come to the Chamber and criticise, having listened to the Taoiseach’s ministerial colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, yesterday and the speech today of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, I am left with no other option. People want solutions. They do not want shouting from the sidelines. They want a plan. A few weeks ago my party submitted to the Department of Finance a costed pre-budget submission. It was a document full of choices, which set out a route to recovery. The Government took some of our advice and backed down on some cuts. In addition, it went after the public health budget subsidising private health care. However, it did not go far enough.

History will judge the Government badly, as it has made all the wrong choices. Never has a Government promised so much and delivered so little. After this budget, the Taoiseach cannot stand up in the Chamber and claim it is all Fianna Fáil’s fault. He cannot wring his hands and say there was no option and that the Government was obliged to do this. This is its budget and these are its choices.

While Fianna Fáil caused this mess——

——today the Government has added to it.

Tá daoine ina shuí sa bhaile a thug tacaíocht do bhur gcuid páirtithe. Tá siad ag éisteacht leis an gcáinfhaisnéis seo. D’éist siad leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire, an Teachta Howlin, inné. Tá said ag iarraidh cén difríocht a rinne an toghchán i mí Feabhra seo caite. Is cinnte gur tháinig athrú ar na páirtithe sa rialtas, ach níor tháinig athrú ar bith ar polasaithe an Rialtais. Nuair a chuaigh na céadta míle daoine chuig na bothanna vótaíochta, ní hamháin go raibh said ag iarraidh deireadh a chur le ré Fianna Fáil, ach bhí said ag iarraidh deireadh a chur leis na polasaithe lochtacha a bhíá chur i bhfeidhm ag Fianna Fáil freisin. Cad a chuala siad inniu agus inné? Chuala siad Fine Gael agus an Lucht Oibre ag cur na polasaithe lochtacha sin i bhfeidhm go huile is go hiomlán.

People who watched the Budget Statement will be numbed by its effect as they add up the total loss of income from the Minister’s stealth charges and spending cuts. They have had two days of bad news of cuts and taxes mounted on top of one another with no regard as to how they are meant to pay for any of it. Ordinary families have been crying out for fairness. The Taoiseach and the Minister told Members repeatedly that, if anything, this budget would be fair. In his State broadcast last Sunday night the Taoiseach told the people they had not caused the crisis. Today, however, the Government is making every single person pay for it. Is this the fairness the Minister had in mind? I refer to a fairness that gives Anglo Irish Bank €3.1 billion of taxpayers’ money every year while 500,000 people cry out for investment in jobs. This is a fairness that allows the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance to earn €200,000, €184,000 and €169,000, respectively, per year, while ordinary working families are struggling to make ends meet. Of course, the Government is not going after the high earners in this budget. Last year the Minister for Finance was in receipt of a ministerial pension on top of his Dáil salary. The Taoiseach is aware of this because last year, when he still was an Opposition Deputy on this side of the House, he was in receipt of a ministerial pension. Although the Government now talks about how it will change everything, its members engaged in such practises in opposition only 12 months ago.

Had Sinn Féin not put these payments on the agenda, sitting Deputies would still be in receipt of them. The Taoiseach did not go after the high earners in this budget because he and his colleagues are the high earners. Times are tough but they are not tough for the Government or its political cronies.

Tell me, Taoiseach, riddle me this——

——what happened to those who caused the crisis? What does the budget say to them — the bankers, the developers and the politicians who were there at the time of the crash? Where is the fairness in the budget for them? We know that 22 of the top 50 Anglo Irish executives who were there at the time of the collapse are still in their positions. Nineteen of them earn more than €175,000 a year, paid for from the public purse. We know that the former taoisigh, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, are on pensions, after the Government’s reduction in them, of €147,000 per year.

While the Government is increasing taxes on ordinary working families, Ministers, junior Ministers and officeholders are still able to claim an unvouched tax write-down of up to €3,500 to have their laundry done when they stay in Dublin hotels.

That is the type of fairness the Government wants to introduce in this budget. If this is the Taoiseach’s and the Minister’s idea of fairness, it is a very skewed sense of fairness.

What was fair about the cuts yesterday?

They were of the most vicious nature. The Government went after children, the disabled, lone parents, widows and carers. These were its five target groups. It spun a line about protecting social welfare payments — about not cutting the basic unemployment rate. All the while the Government was cutting the extra child benefit rates, multiple birth grants, abolishing disability benefits for those under 18 years of age and slashing it almost in half for young people. It attacked lone parents on multiple fronts, going after widow and widower pensions, cutting the back to education allowance, slashing the fuel allowance and going after carers. That is just one small element of what the Government did in one Department. The Government deceived the Irish people in its cuts savings. It claimed, for example, that social welfare cuts would amount to €475 million, but that is just for 2012. In a full year social welfare cuts will amount to €811 million, the education cuts will amount to €316 million and health cuts will amount to €837 million. I note that the Minister is nodding his head, but this book says that the full year effect of the health cuts will be €797 million. At least I know now what to buy the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance for Christmas because they cannot do the sums. They are €40 million out in their sums in this book and the book that was presented yesterday.

We demand that €40 million back. We will give them a calculator at Christmas or maybe they are just continuing with the Kevin Cardiff school of economics with €3.6 billion here and €40 million in health cuts there; sure what the hell; it does not make a difference.

There are cuts of €1.9 billion across these three areas and these were the front-line services the Government was supposed to protect.

Tá gach páirtí istigh anseo ag rá go bhfuil siad i bhfabhar na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge. Ní leor briathra breátha agus caint gan ghníomh. Tá sé rísholéir anois nach bhfuil ar siúl ag an Rialtas ach cur i gcéill agus bréaga. Tá gearradh siar de 10% déanta ar bhuiséad na Gaeltachta. Tá an Ghaeltacht faoi ionsaí, tá Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga le dúnadh ag an Rialtas, níl sé chun cead a thabhairt toghchán a reáchtáil fá choinne bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta úr a thoghadh agus táísliú céime tugtha don údarás. Níl go leor maoiniúá chur ar fáil chun poist a chruthú agus a chaomhnú sa Ghaeltacht agus tá an straitéis 20 bliain caite ar leataobh ag an Rialtas. Beidh na impleachtaí marfacha seo uilig ag titim ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus todhchaí na Gaeilge sa tír seo go hiomlán. Ní leor sin ar chor ar bith.

The biggest cut yesterday was in people’s expectations because there is no hope offered in this budget to the growing numbers of working poor, to the struggling middle income families or to the most vulnerable in society. There is no vision for business, no economic thinking that adds up. This is not what people signed up for; it is not what they wanted when they voted for change. Today, people who are already struggling are being told they will have to pay more stealth taxes, a household charge and higher VAT, motor taxes, fuel and excise costs. Rural dwellers are being discriminated against. They are being told that they will have to pay septic tank charges and we know that water charges and property taxes are on the way for all.

The Minister, Deputy Noonan, announced €1 billion in new taxes today and there was some applause for going after wealth. I am glad about some of the measures that were introduced and I will deal with them in more specific detail later. However, let us deal with the four main stealth charges. They are motor tax, the full year effect of which will yield €46 million, the household charge which will yield €160 million, the increase in VAT which will yield €670 million and the carbon tax which will yield €109 million, which together add up to €985 million. Those are the measures from which the Government will get €1 billion in new taxes — stealth taxes that affect the most vulnerable in the most indiscriminate way. However, people are also being told that none of these taxes will go towards public services. Health, education and welfare will all suffer under this Government. The Taoiseach is increasing taxes to continue the failed banking policy of Fianna Fáil.

Yesterday we heard the Government cut €2.2 billion from public spending. Next year our debt servicing costs will increase by €2.6 billion. The Taoiseach should be honest with the people and tell them where their money is going. He should also be honest and explain that all the Government’s cuts and taxes will not work. The Exchequer deficit remains large because instead of directing our resources into creating jobs and growing the economy, the Government has nearly spent it all on bailing out the banks and it is continuing along that failed path. Let us be clear about the position because the Government cannot blame it all on Fianna Fáil. Since Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office in March of this year, the Government has pumped a staggering €20.7 billion of our money into the banks, including €3.1 billion into Anglo Irish Bank, and it will make a further such payment on 31 March next year, the year after and each year after that up until 2025.

The reckless economic policies pursued by Fianna Fáil during the boom created the economic crisis. The years of austerity and bank bailouts that it followed deepened the crisis. Now the continuation of these same policies by Fine Gael and the Labour Party will only serve to make matters worse.

Across the country people will have watched the Minister deliver his budget speech today and they will be growing increasingly despondent. They will feel angry, hurt and badly let down. I appeal directly to every one of them — the people who want change and voted for it last February, and to every person who feels we deserve better — and I want every person contemplating emigration, or who is at his or her lowest, or feels there is no light at the end of this tunnel to know that real change is still possible and that there are people in this State who believe in, and have a vision of, a better, fairer Ireland and, with their help, can make this a better country.

There are better choices despite the fact that Fine Gael and the Labour Party decided not to take them in this budget. Sinn Féin has championed the alternative. It has argued that the priority in this budget should have been investment in jobs. We argued against spending cuts and pointed out that the tax system needed to be overhauled and the wealthy had to pay their fair share. I advise the Taoiseach and the Minister that no wealthy person ever died from having to pay more taxes. However, the cuts the Minister inflicted on health services and social welfare payments yesterday will mean the difference between life and death. Some 5,000 people die prematurely every year in this State because of inequality in areas such as health. Up to 2,000 people die each winter due to the cold. How many more people will die from fuel poverty or inadequate access to health care following the Government’s cuts? As if the cuts were not bad enough, today it heaped more pain on people with its stealth taxes — the VAT rise, the carbon tax and the household charge.

Undoubtedly, Ireland needs to stabilise its finances. We need to return to the bond markets as soon as possible and Sinn Féin is of the opinion that the sooner the better we get out of this mess so that we can get back our sovereignty, but where we differ with this and the previous Government is over the best and fastest way to do that. I am firmly of the view that continuing with Fianna Fáil’s failed banking policy will not help our chances of recovery. I am joined in this view by economists of the left, centre and right. It is hard to find somebody bar Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil, the ECB and banks who think it is unjustifiable to put €3.1 billion into Anglo Irish Bank or to continue to repay the unguaranteed bondholders in full but that is what the Government is doing. It has already fully recapitalised the banks while the rest of Europe waits to see if the EFSF or ECB will pick up the tab for them. Bailing out banks and bondholders while asking the sick, the elderly and children to pick up the tab is shameful. Leaving aside the banking crisis, we have a structural deficit that must be reduced. In our pre-budget submission we set out a package of measures that would close the deficit, starting with a figure of €3.5 billion in new measures in 2012. This would bring the deficit to 8.3% of GDP when implemented alongside our proposed €7 billion stimulus package. We propose this stimulus package could be funded from what remains of the National Pension Reserve Fund and by partial investment from the European Investment Bank.

This would create a minimum of 60,000 jobs and potentially save up to 100,000 others.

Our approach to economic recovery is far more comprehensive than the Government’s deficit focus strategy. The Government believes it can cut its way out of the recession, but this was tried by Fianna Fáil and it completely and utterly failed; €20.6 billion of unfair taxes and cuts later, has the Government not learned the lesson? If cuts and flat taxes worked, the deficit would have closed by now.

The fact that the budget is predicated on a set of growth figures for next year which have already been reviewed downwards by observers means the budgetary adjustment will not have its desired effect. I am sure the Minister is blushing at the fact that after huge anticipation a few days ago about what the growth rates would be in 2012 he came to the Chamber today and downgraded the rates by 0.3%. Is the Government making this up as it goes along?

Our measures are fair, would be non-deflationary and the most likely to work.

The domestic economy is on its knees. People’s spending power has been demolished and today the Government has added to the mess by cutting it more. Less money in people’s pockets means less money in tills, and less money in tills means fewer jobs. It is a vicious cycle, which is why we proposed measures such as a wealth tax, a third rate of income tax on earned income over €100,000 and abolishing the universal social charge.

The Government has set itself numerical targets which cannot be reached because it does not factor in the effects its bad policy has on economic activity. I want to deal with some of the specifics of these bad policy measures. I do not know whether I am the only person in the State who remembers the five point plan. Does the Taoiseach remember it?


Point 1 was a €7 billion stimulus package to create 100,000 jobs. The Labour Party had a similar plan.


Today 444,000 people are on the live register, which is 9,500 more than when the Government took office. We cannot count all the people who have emigrated or those who are not eligible for welfare assistance such as the self-employed, for whom no safety net is provided.

The Taoiseach seems to think emigration is a safety valve for unemployment. I know it is hard to take——


——but if he listens, he might learn something. A total of 54,000 have emigrated since he took office. I want to tell him what emigration is really like. Emigration will mean empty chairs at the dinner table this Christmas; it means grandparents never seeing their grandchildren and families and communities being devastated. Has the Taoiseach walked through any of our third level campuses recently?


Has he? Has he found a student who believes emigration is not part of his or her future? He will be hard-pressed to find a student who does not believe this.

How does the Taoiseach tell the parents of these children the reason he is driving them out of the State and he has prioritised private bank bondholders over the future of Irish schoolchildren?

Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach nach dtiocfaidh cuid mhór de na daoine seo ar ais go dtí an tír seo choíche. Ní bheidh an deis sin acu. Tá daoine inniu sna Stáit Aontaithe, san Astráil agus i dtíortha eile agus ní tiocfaidh siad ar ais go dtí an tír seo go deo. Ní scéal úr é seo. Tharla sé roimhe seo. Chonaic muid an rud céanna sna 1950í agus 1960í, agus arís sna 1980í.

Bhí ar m’athair agus mo mháthair an tír seo a fhágáil agus imeacht go hAlbain, an áit ina rugadh mé fhéin, mo dheartháireacha agus mo dheirfiúracha. Bhí an t-ádh linn go raibh deis againn teacht abhaile go hÉirinn i ndiaidh 20 bliain thar lear. Ní raibh an deis chéanna ag go leor daoine eile. Níor éirigh go maith le go leor daoine nuair a d’fhág siad an tír seo. D’obair said go dícheallach, chuir siad airgead i leataobh le haghaidh a gcuid teaghlaigh agus chuidigh siad leis an tír. Nuair a tháinig amanna crua, chaill siad a gcuid post agus a lóistín agus bhí orthu cónaí ar na sráideanna. Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil siad fós le feiceáil ar fud na bailte móra i Sasana. Is mór an náire é don Taoiseach gur fhógair an Rialtas inné go bhfuil €1.3 milliún le baint as na daoine a d’fhág an tír sna 1950í agus 1960í, agus atá ar an ngannchuid i Londain inniu. Is mór an náire é daoibh.

The Taoiseach gives a good talk on jobs, but strip away the rhetoric and take it down to the bone and there is nothing there. He might have got away with this in the first few days and weeks of government, but now it is wearing thin. Yesterday he cut the capital budget by €750 million.

Enterprise Ireland’s budget was cut and the Government went after disposable income. Today the VAT rate and fuel prices have been raised. Taoiseach, you are actively trying to cut jobs.

The 2% hike in VAT will see more businesses put under strain from diminishing consumer spending and more of them will go to the wall. The vicious cycle began by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party of relying on indirect taxation is being continued under the watch of the Government. Not only will this measure be tough for business and jobs, it will disproportionately affect lower income earners who pay more of their income in VAT. The €670 million it is stated this figure will bring in is less than what Sinn Féin proposes to bring in through a wealth tax. We propose to bring in €800 million.

The Government talks about tough choices, but it is not tough to go after a spending tax. It is tough to go after wealth, the vested interests and change the status quo. France has the luxury of wealthy individuals appealing to the government to tax them more, just to be patriotic. In Ireland the wealthiest in society stand behind the Government and ask for the most vulnerable to be taxed more and the Government acquiesces.


One cannot squeeze any more blood from the stone; it is dry.

The VAT rate rise announced today is a mistake. The Minister knows this because it is the argument he made in opposition. This is not to mention the impact the VAT rate rise will have on already struggling Border towns, including in my home county of Donegal. Increasing VAT in the hope it will generate enough cash to reduce the deficit is absolute nonsense. By its nature, it will have a diminishing effect on returns as people spend less. We can already see this happening as VAT returns have collapsed this year. What the Government is doing is attempting to run just to stand still.

I listened to Fianna Fáil speak about the unjustifiable nature of increasing VAT, but let us be clear: the only difference between Fianna Fáil’s VAT plans and those of the Government is 12 months. Fianna Fáil also saw VAT as an easy option. It also drove hard-pressed retailers in Border counties to the wall. It pushed up the cost of living for ordinary people and is no more interested in saving jobs than the Government.


The Government’s attacks on education will do little to help the knowledge economy. The State cannot come out of the crisis without the tools to do so. These tools include a well trained and well educated workforce. By making education the preserve of the elite and allowing an opportunity only for those who can afford it, the Government is not ensuring a workforce for the future. This is what it has done through cuts to capitation grants and in funding for higher education bodies. It has also increased fees by €250, about which I am sure the students are delighted——

It is also abolishing maintenance grants for postgraduate students. The Government is pulling down the shutters on the futures of thousands of young men and women not lucky enough to be born into a wealthy family. In this day and age, in a First World country, I do not know how anyone can stand over this. This is a mantra that is meant to distract people while the Government is holding them upside down and shaking the spare coins out of their pockets with its VAT increases, household charges, water charges and other stealth taxes.

Keeping rates and bands the same means keeping them the same for everyone. Therefore that means that those on €20,000 are treated the same as those on €200,000. That is nothing to be proud of.

We have proposed the abolition of the universal social charge, to be replaced with the income levy, with the lower rate reduced to 1%, while reintroducing the health levy. This would mean that everyone earning under €75,000 would be better off under Sinn Féin’s direct taxation proposals. The Government has failed to do that today. It would also mean 500,000 people being taken out of the tax net.

The Government has claimed that people will come out of this budget with the same take home pay. What it does not say, however, is that when they get home with their pay packets, they will be fleeced by higher bills, charges, stealth taxes and a range of other measures aimed at reducing their disposable income.

The Minister for Finance has announced a tinkering with the universal social charge. I welcome the fact that he has ensured that those earning less than €193 per week will be exempt from the universal social charge. However, does the Taoiseach think it is fair that people earning €193 or €194 a week are still paying this unjust charge? There were 514,000 more people brought into the tax net as a result of the universal social charge. The measures announced today will leave 184,000 of them still in the tax net. These people are paying a regressive charge that is not only damaging their quality of life, but also economic activity in terms of consumption.

To have lifted everyone earning under €15,000 out of the universal social charge would have cost €120 million. Taking everyone out from under the minimum wage would have cost €170 million. Sinn Féin would have abolished it, but even this measure would have been fairer than what the Government has done today.

We look at tax in a different way. We go after wealth, tax breaks and loopholes. Reducing the pension ceiling and capping or standardising pension reliefs would bring in €550 million alone. Halving mortgage interest for landlords would bring in €400 million. The changes that we proposed to capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax would bring in €360 million. This is a strategy that increases revenue without damaging the wider economy.

Flat rate taxes are regressive. The Labour Party seems to have mixed up the definitions of “regressive” and “progressive” since its election manifesto, so I will simplify it for the party. Regressive taxes are unfair and not as productive. If they look it up in the dictionary, they will find it beside property taxes.

Nowhere is the Minister for Finance’s political choice to go after the socially and economically vulnerable more stark than in his decision to levy a flat rate regressive tax on households. A household charge is a stealth tax. The way he has levied it will hit those struggling the hardest. Regardless of income or property size, everyone will pay €100. A family with three children, a mortgage of €1,000 a month, and mounting energy and food bills will pay €100. A wealthy individual, however, who is living in a valuable home with no mortgage, will also pay €100. Perhaps the Taoiseach can tell me how this measure is fair.

Some Government party Members will say it is only €100. They will say that because they have simply no idea what €100 means for a family that is already on the breadline. Add that €100 to increased bills, increase travel costs and cuts in income, as announced yesterday, and we will see what it starts to mean and how it adds up. It is only €100 this year but we know from the programme for Government and the memorandum of understanding that Fianna Fáil negotiated that it is to increase year on year.

What is more distressing is that the Minister for Finance is levying this charge on people, many of whom are in mortgage distress. These people took out huge mortgages, at high interest rates in some cases, and paid massive sums in stamp duty just to own a home. The Minister has done little or nothing for the 100,000 households in mortgage distress. Today he has said he expects them to pay the Government a €100 household charge on top of their bills. It is neither right nor fair.

The Minister has lined up stealth taxes in this budget but I wonder if he has given any thought to their effects. Take motor tax, for example. I know from my own county of Donegal — and it is the same right across rural Ireland, including the west — that people are dependent on cars for transport. We do not have trains in Donegal or public transport networks like other regions. People need their cars to get to work, drop their children to school, take care of relatives and go to the shops. They need their cars to get from A to B. That is thanks to the legacy of bad transport planning by previous governments, which ignored the west. None the less, the Minister has increased motor tax and, in addition, fuel is going to go up. We also know that there is a proposal to examine VRT, resulting more motor taxes when the report comes back next year. Therefore, the driver of a mid-range car can expect a €46 increase in motor tax, and people are angry about it. People in County Donegal will ask whether they are expected to pay €46 more given the roads on which they are travelling, but they already pay €46 nearly every second week to have their shock absorbers fixed due to the potholes. Incidentally, these potholes will not be repaired because the Minister has cut €750 million from the capital budget.

The changes to capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax do not go far enough. Yesterday, the Government attacked child benefit to save €70 million in a full year. When I heard about these cuts I was reminded that last year, Deputy Joan Burton told this house when Fianna Fáil cut child benefit that it was a reflection of how few women were in government and how little power women had. As she is now in government, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, could have gone to her Cabinet and explained that an increase in capital gains tax to 40% would have raised €195 million. In addition, reducing all the capital acquisitions tax thresholds by 25%, while increasing the rate to 35%, would have raised €165 million. In today’s Budget Statement, however, the Minister for Finance has allowed capital gains tax exemptions. If the Minister for Social Protection had been able to convince the Cabinet of the need for these measures, she would have saved the cut to child benefit. She could then have rightly declared that she, as a woman, had wielded considerable political power.

The Minister for Finance has failed to deal with the legacy of Fianna Fáil property reliefs which drove the bubble. He has extended a capital gains holiday for people who choose, once again. to speculate in the property market. He has cut stamp duty for non-residential property from 6% to 2% from midnight. His attitude to property should be compared with his attitude yesterday to young, severely disabled people, whom he told he valued half as much as the day before. He is the same as Fianna Fáil Ministers he condemned last year. He will protect high earners whom he fears will become insolvent, but he will go after the most vulnerable and tell them that he has no choice. He is trying to create speculation in the property market yet again but will not deal with upward-only rent reviews which are destroying businesses and killing jobs. Not dealing with upward-only rent reviews means the State will pay €10 million in rent. The State rents properties that are locked in to upward-only rent reviews totalling €58 million. As late as this morning, the Taoiseach told us that matter was under review. Did the Minister for Finance not give him a copy of his script before the Taoiseach took the Order of Business?

The Taoiseach talks about jobs. I got a message from someone in my own constituency who said he was closing up and jobs would be lost because of upward-only rent reviews. The Taoiseach will probably say that there is nothing he can do about it, but does he know that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is applying the upward-only rent review? That Department is putting that person and others out of a job. Regardless of any legal advice, this State has individuals and businesses tied into upward-only rent reviews. I have a full list of them in my office and will pass them on to the Taoiseach if he wants.

That is something the Taoiseach can deal with straight away, here and now.

There are 100,000 families in serious mortgage distress, but where is the fairness for them in this budget? Almost 70 families are falling into serious mortgage distress every single day. While repossession rates have been low in comparison with other countries, that will not last forever. Some 1,048 families have lost their homes in the last two years, which is 1,048 repossessions too many. Without Government action this number will increase.

The Fine Gael-Labour programme for Government included clear promises on mortgage distress. They promised to direct mortgage providers in receipt of State support to cut their costs, yet today mortgages are more costly than when the Government took office. They promised to make greater use of mortgage interest supplement to support families who cannot meet their mortgage payments. Yesterday, however, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, announced a cut of €22.5 million to this benefit and increased the personal contribution for struggling home owners by up to €572 per year. Despite all the promises made during the election and in the programme for Government, Fine Gael and Labour are now taking the same minimalist approach that was taken by Fianna Fáil. Across the State, thousands of families face sleepless nights wondering how they will pay their mortgage bill next month. They will be faced with choosing between falling into mortgage arrears or buying their children presents for Christmas. They will have watched the budget speech, searching for something that would give them hope, and they will have been bitterly disappointed. They will ask a simple question: if the Government could find €20.7 billion for the banks since taking office, why could it not find anything for them? If it is so easy to bail out the banks comprehensively, why can the Government not provide any support to families at risk of losing their homes?

As it did following the publication of the Keane report in October, the Government has left struggling home owners at the mercy of the banks and saddled tens of thousands of home owners with decades of unsustainable debt. It could have chosen a different course and looked to prioritise maintaining the family home. It could have sought appropriate alternatives to ensure debt sustainability and found a way to ensure that the burden of mortgage distress is shared fairly between the borrowers and lenders.

The approach of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in increasing mortgage interest relief to 30% for first-time buyers who purchased homes between 2004 and 2008 demonstrates that he does not understand the magnitude of the problem. This is the wrong approach as it will assist some but leave many others in continued distress. It is arbitrary, discriminatory and not enough. What about the family which bought a home before 2004, the family which needed to upgrade because of an increase in family size and the family which relocated in search of work? Does your measure assist these struggling mortgage holders? No, it does not.

I am very conscious that the Government has produced the budget we are debating against a backdrop of an intensifying European crisis that could have far-reaching implications for the future of Ireland and for the eurozone. My party leader and I have asked the Government on numerous occasions whether there is a contingency plan in place for dealing with any eventualities arising from the euro crisis. We know other Governments, including the French and Germans, have been developing such plans. Even investment firms in this city are developing such plans and have passed them on to their customers. Nevertheless, each time we raise this issue in the House the Taoiseach tells us he has every confidence in European partners and their ability to stabilise the crisis.

Nobody believes the Taoiseach; not the public, the markets nor this House. I urge the Taoiseach to bring the Opposition parties into Government Buildings to discuss this issue, in confidence if required.

The Government must urgently reassure the public that it is taking this crisis seriously and preparing for all scenarios. The events unfolding in Europe are frightening people. Agreements are being reached between powerful EU member states and Ireland is not even represented at the table. Last week the Taoiseach said clearly he was against further treaty change but this morning, the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, stated that the Government was open to negotiation on treaty change. Where does the Government stand on the issue? Does it support enshrining austerity and recession-inducing budgetary policy into EU treaty law? Does it support giving the European Court of Justice a say in policing member state budgets? Does it support the transfer of fiscal powers from this House to the EU institutions?

Does it support ruling out any private sector involvement in burden sharing in dealing with the currency crisis? I ask these questions because these are the key elements of the proposals that Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel will bring to the EU crisis summit on Friday. These are the demands they will be making. More importantly, these are proposals that will consign this State and its people to a decade of crippling austerity. If agreed this weekend, they will have negative consequences for employment, debt and reducing the deficit. In short, they will undermine everything the Government is claiming to have achieved with this week’s disastrous budget.

What will be the Government’s bottom line in the crisis summit this weekend and does it even have one? What price is the Government willing to accept in exchange for wearing the economic straitjacket being proposed by Sarkozy and Merkel? Will the Taoiseach return from the summit like Albert Reynolds did in 1992 with a bag full of euro gold, hoping the electorate will be bedazzled into accepting treaty changes with long-term and damaging consequences for Ireland and the eurozone? Will this Government agree to changes in the hope of avoiding a referendum, using technical legal arguments to avoid giving the people their say? Some 90 years ago today, one of the Minister for Finance’s predecessors signed a treaty that had far-reaching and negative consequences for the Irish people. Let us hope the Taoiseach does not come back to Ireland after this summit having made the same mistake.

The Government has been softening up the Irish people for months, telling them it had to deliver this budget and it had no other choices. It raised the spectre of the troika and the memorandum of understanding, which the Government indicated it would renegotiate, on every occasion to defend its own economic agenda.


There were choices to be made this week and my party’s pre-budget submission set them out. Our submission chose not to go after ordinary families but to invest in growth and jobs. It chose to cut the high earners in the public sector and tax those who could afford it. The Government claims it could not have implemented such choices but that is untrue. Members of my party have met representatives of the troika and they told us they would accept such choices as long as the main budgetary targets are met.

All of these choices damage the economy and will damage people’s families. Last night a homeless man was found dead in Dublin and it is suspected he died from hypothermia. Does that move the Taoiseach? He is a member of a Government that allows people to die of cold on the streets. Every year after the budget, since I have been elected to the Seanad and Dáil, I leave Leinster House by the Kildare Street entrance. Every Deputy and Senator will know there are two places where homeless people sleep that are within sight of the plinth. I walk past those homeless people and wonder if the budget has changed their life in any way. The answer is always “No”.


With this budget the Taoiseach and his Government are exposed. The Irish people sat in judgment of Fianna Fáil and I promise the Taoiseach they will judge Fine Gael and Labour the same way.
=======
Last February a huge majority of the electorate voted for change. They voted for an end to the failed policies of Fianna Fáil and the politics of the Green Party. They voted for a new approach to the economy, unemployment, the banks, public services and political reform. Moreover, they voted for an end to political cronyism. They wanted change, fairness and equality. Most of all, they want hope tomorrow will be better than yesterday.

In the nine months since Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office, they have broken promise after promise. They have slowly but steadily dashed the hopes of the people who put their faith in them. Across the State, despite the litany of broken promises, people were still holding out for good news. They still were yearning for hope the Government’s budget announcements this week would make tomorrow better than yesterday. While I have no desire to come to the Chamber and criticise, having listened to the Taoiseach’s ministerial colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, yesterday and the speech today of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, I am left with no other option. People want solutions. They do not want shouting from the sidelines. They want a plan. A few weeks ago my party submitted to the Department of Finance a costed pre-budget submission. It was a document full of choices, which set out a route to recovery. The Government took some of our advice and backed down on some cuts. In addition, it went after the public health budget subsidising private health care. However, it did not go far enough.

History will judge the Government badly, as it has made all the wrong choices. Never has a Government promised so much and delivered so little. After this budget, the Taoiseach cannot stand up in the Chamber and claim it is all Fianna Fáil’s fault. He cannot wring his hands and say there was no option and that the Government was obliged to do this. This is its budget and these are its choices.

While Fianna Fáil caused this mess——

——today the Government has added to it.

Tá daoine ina shuí sa bhaile a thug tacaíocht do bhur gcuid páirtithe. Tá siad ag éisteacht leis an gcáinfhaisnéis seo. D’éist siad leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire, an Teachta Howlin, inné. Tá said ag iarraidh cén difríocht a rinne an toghchán i mí Feabhra seo caite. Is cinnte gur tháinig athrú ar na páirtithe sa rialtas, ach níor tháinig athrú ar bith ar polasaithe an Rialtais. Nuair a chuaigh na céadta míle daoine chuig na bothanna vótaíochta, ní hamháin go raibh said ag iarraidh deireadh a chur le ré Fianna Fáil, ach bhí said ag iarraidh deireadh a chur leis na polasaithe lochtacha a bhíá chur i bhfeidhm ag Fianna Fáil freisin. Cad a chuala siad inniu agus inné? Chuala siad Fine Gael agus an Lucht Oibre ag cur na polasaithe lochtacha sin i bhfeidhm go huile is go hiomlán.

People who watched the Budget Statement will be numbed by its effect as they add up the total loss of income from the Minister’s stealth charges and spending cuts. They have had two days of bad news of cuts and taxes mounted on top of one another with no regard as to how they are meant to pay for any of it. Ordinary families have been crying out for fairness. The Taoiseach and the Minister told Members repeatedly that, if anything, this budget would be fair. In his State broadcast last Sunday night the Taoiseach told the people they had not caused the crisis. Today, however, the Government is making every single person pay for it. Is this the fairness the Minister had in mind? I refer to a fairness that gives Anglo Irish Bank €3.1 billion of taxpayers’ money every year while 500,000 people cry out for investment in jobs. This is a fairness that allows the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance to earn €200,000, €184,000 and €169,000, respectively, per year, while ordinary working families are struggling to make ends meet. Of course, the Government is not going after the high earners in this budget. Last year the Minister for Finance was in receipt of a ministerial pension on top of his Dáil salary. The Taoiseach is aware of this because last year, when he still was an Opposition Deputy on this side of the House, he was in receipt of a ministerial pension. Although the Government now talks about how it will change everything, its members engaged in such practises in opposition only 12 months ago.

Had Sinn Féin not put these payments on the agenda, sitting Deputies would still be in receipt of them. The Taoiseach did not go after the high earners in this budget because he and his colleagues are the high earners. Times are tough but they are not tough for the Government or its political cronies.

Tell me, Taoiseach, riddle me this——

——what happened to those who caused the crisis? What does the budget say to them — the bankers, the developers and the politicians who were there at the time of the crash? Where is the fairness in the budget for them? We know that 22 of the top 50 Anglo Irish executives who were there at the time of the collapse are still in their positions. Nineteen of them earn more than €175,000 a year, paid for from the public purse. We know that the former taoisigh, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, are on pensions, after the Government’s reduction in them, of €147,000 per year.

While the Government is increasing taxes on ordinary working families, Ministers, junior Ministers and officeholders are still able to claim an unvouched tax write-down of up to €3,500 to have their laundry done when they stay in Dublin hotels.

That is the type of fairness the Government wants to introduce in this budget. If this is the Taoiseach’s and the Minister’s idea of fairness, it is a very skewed sense of fairness.

What was fair about the cuts yesterday?

They were of the most vicious nature. The Government went after children, the disabled, lone parents, widows and carers. These were its five target groups. It spun a line about protecting social welfare payments — about not cutting the basic unemployment rate. All the while the Government was cutting the extra child benefit rates, multiple birth grants, abolishing disability benefits for those under 18 years of age and slashing it almost in half for young people. It attacked lone parents on multiple fronts, going after widow and widower pensions, cutting the back to education allowance, slashing the fuel allowance and going after carers. That is just one small element of what the Government did in one Department. The Government deceived the Irish people in its cuts savings. It claimed, for example, that social welfare cuts would amount to €475 million, but that is just for 2012. In a full year social welfare cuts will amount to €811 million, the education cuts will amount to €316 million and health cuts will amount to €837 million. I note that the Minister is nodding his head, but this book says that the full year effect of the health cuts will be €797 million. At least I know now what to buy the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance for Christmas because they cannot do the sums. They are €40 million out in their sums in this book and the book that was presented yesterday.

We demand that €40 million back. We will give them a calculator at Christmas or maybe they are just continuing with the Kevin Cardiff school of economics with €3.6 billion here and €40 million in health cuts there; sure what the hell; it does not make a difference.

There are cuts of €1.9 billion across these three areas and these were the front-line services the Government was supposed to protect.

Tá gach páirtí istigh anseo ag rá go bhfuil siad i bhfabhar na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge. Ní leor briathra breátha agus caint gan ghníomh. Tá sé rísholéir anois nach bhfuil ar siúl ag an Rialtas ach cur i gcéill agus bréaga. Tá gearradh siar de 10% déanta ar bhuiséad na Gaeltachta. Tá an Ghaeltacht faoi ionsaí, tá Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga le dúnadh ag an Rialtas, níl sé chun cead a thabhairt toghchán a reáchtáil fá choinne bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta úr a thoghadh agus táísliú céime tugtha don údarás. Níl go leor maoiniúá chur ar fáil chun poist a chruthú agus a chaomhnú sa Ghaeltacht agus tá an straitéis 20 bliain caite ar leataobh ag an Rialtas. Beidh na impleachtaí marfacha seo uilig ag titim ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus todhchaí na Gaeilge sa tír seo go hiomlán. Ní leor sin ar chor ar bith.

The biggest cut yesterday was in people’s expectations because there is no hope offered in this budget to the growing numbers of working poor, to the struggling middle income families or to the most vulnerable in society. There is no vision for business, no economic thinking that adds up. This is not what people signed up for; it is not what they wanted when they voted for change. Today, people who are already struggling are being told they will have to pay more stealth taxes, a household charge and higher VAT, motor taxes, fuel and excise costs. Rural dwellers are being discriminated against. They are being told that they will have to pay septic tank charges and we know that water charges and property taxes are on the way for all.

The Minister, Deputy Noonan, announced €1 billion in new taxes today and there was some applause for going after wealth. I am glad about some of the measures that were introduced and I will deal with them in more specific detail later. However, let us deal with the four main stealth charges. They are motor tax, the full year effect of which will yield €46 million, the household charge which will yield €160 million, the increase in VAT which will yield €670 million and the carbon tax which will yield €109 million, which together add up to €985 million. Those are the measures from which the Government will get €1 billion in new taxes — stealth taxes that affect the most vulnerable in the most indiscriminate way. However, people are also being told that none of these taxes will go towards public services. Health, education and welfare will all suffer under this Government. The Taoiseach is increasing taxes to continue the failed banking policy of Fianna Fáil.

Yesterday we heard the Government cut €2.2 billion from public spending. Next year our debt servicing costs will increase by €2.6 billion. The Taoiseach should be honest with the people and tell them where their money is going. He should also be honest and explain that all the Government’s cuts and taxes will not work. The Exchequer deficit remains large because instead of directing our resources into creating jobs and growing the economy, the Government has nearly spent it all on bailing out the banks and it is continuing along that failed path. Let us be clear about the position because the Government cannot blame it all on Fianna Fáil. Since Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office in March of this year, the Government has pumped a staggering €20.7 billion of our money into the banks, including €3.1 billion into Anglo Irish Bank, and it will make a further such payment on 31 March next year, the year after and each year after that up until 2025.

The reckless economic policies pursued by Fianna Fáil during the boom created the economic crisis. The years of austerity and bank bailouts that it followed deepened the crisis. Now the continuation of these same policies by Fine Gael and the Labour Party will only serve to make matters worse.

Across the country people will have watched the Minister deliver his budget speech today and they will be growing increasingly despondent. They will feel angry, hurt and badly let down. I appeal directly to every one of them — the people who want change and voted for it last February, and to every person who feels we deserve better — and I want every person contemplating emigration, or who is at his or her lowest, or feels there is no light at the end of this tunnel to know that real change is still possible and that there are people in this State who believe in, and have a vision of, a better, fairer Ireland and, with their help, can make this a better country.

There are better choices despite the fact that Fine Gael and the Labour Party decided not to take them in this budget. Sinn Féin has championed the alternative. It has argued that the priority in this budget should have been investment in jobs. We argued against spending cuts and pointed out that the tax system needed to be overhauled and the wealthy had to pay their fair share. I advise the Taoiseach and the Minister that no wealthy person ever died from having to pay more taxes. However, the cuts the Minister inflicted on health services and social welfare payments yesterday will mean the difference between life and death. Some 5,000 people die prematurely every year in this State because of inequality in areas such as health. Up to 2,000 people die each winter due to the cold. How many more people will die from fuel poverty or inadequate access to health care following the Government’s cuts? As if the cuts were not bad enough, today it heaped more pain on people with its stealth taxes — the VAT rise, the carbon tax and the household charge.

Undoubtedly, Ireland needs to stabilise its finances. We need to return to the bond markets as soon as possible and Sinn Féin is of the opinion that the sooner the better we get out of this mess so that we can get back our sovereignty, but where we differ with this and the previous Government is over the best and fastest way to do that. I am firmly of the view that continuing with Fianna Fáil’s failed banking policy will not help our chances of recovery. I am joined in this view by economists of the left, centre and right. It is hard to find somebody bar Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil, the ECB and banks who think it is unjustifiable to put €3.1 billion into Anglo Irish Bank or to continue to repay the unguaranteed bondholders in full but that is what the Government is doing. It has already fully recapitalised the banks while the rest of Europe waits to see if the EFSF or ECB will pick up the tab for them. Bailing out banks and bondholders while asking the sick, the elderly and children to pick up the tab is shameful. Leaving aside the banking crisis, we have a structural deficit that must be reduced. In our pre-budget submission we set out a package of measures that would close the deficit, starting with a figure of €3.5 billion in new measures in 2012. This would bring the deficit to 8.3% of GDP when implemented alongside our proposed €7 billion stimulus package. We propose this stimulus package could be funded from what remains of the National Pension Reserve Fund and by partial investment from the European Investment Bank.

This would create a minimum of 60,000 jobs and potentially save up to 100,000 others.

Our approach to economic recovery is far more comprehensive than the Government’s deficit focus strategy. The Government believes it can cut its way out of the recession, but this was tried by Fianna Fáil and it completely and utterly failed; €20.6 billion of unfair taxes and cuts later, has the Government not learned the lesson? If cuts and flat taxes worked, the deficit would have closed by now.

The fact that the budget is predicated on a set of growth figures for next year which have already been reviewed downwards by observers means the budgetary adjustment will not have its desired effect. I am sure the Minister is blushing at the fact that after huge anticipation a few days ago about what the growth rates would be in 2012 he came to the Chamber today and downgraded the rates by 0.3%. Is the Government making this up as it goes along?

Our measures are fair, would be non-deflationary and the most likely to work.

The domestic economy is on its knees. People’s spending power has been demolished and today the Government has added to the mess by cutting it more. Less money in people’s pockets means less money in tills, and less money in tills means fewer jobs. It is a vicious cycle, which is why we proposed measures such as a wealth tax, a third rate of income tax on earned income over €100,000 and abolishing the universal social charge.

The Government has set itself numerical targets which cannot be reached because it does not factor in the effects its bad policy has on economic activity. I want to deal with some of the specifics of these bad policy measures. I do not know whether I am the only person in the State who remembers the five point plan. Does the Taoiseach remember it?


Point 1 was a €7 billion stimulus package to create 100,000 jobs. The Labour Party had a similar plan.


Today 444,000 people are on the live register, which is 9,500 more than when the Government took office. We cannot count all the people who have emigrated or those who are not eligible for welfare assistance such as the self-employed, for whom no safety net is provided.

The Taoiseach seems to think emigration is a safety valve for unemployment. I know it is hard to take——


——but if he listens, he might learn something. A total of 54,000 have emigrated since he took office. I want to tell him what emigration is really like. Emigration will mean empty chairs at the dinner table this Christmas; it means grandparents never seeing their grandchildren and families and communities being devastated. Has the Taoiseach walked through any of our third level campuses recently?


Has he? Has he found a student who believes emigration is not part of his or her future? He will be hard-pressed to find a student who does not believe this.

How does the Taoiseach tell the parents of these children the reason he is driving them out of the State and he has prioritised private bank bondholders over the future of Irish schoolchildren?

Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach nach dtiocfaidh cuid mhór de na daoine seo ar ais go dtí an tír seo choíche. Ní bheidh an deis sin acu. Tá daoine inniu sna Stáit Aontaithe, san Astráil agus i dtíortha eile agus ní tiocfaidh siad ar ais go dtí an tír seo go deo. Ní scéal úr é seo. Tharla sé roimhe seo. Chonaic muid an rud céanna sna 1950í agus 1960í, agus arís sna 1980í.

Bhí ar m’athair agus mo mháthair an tír seo a fhágáil agus imeacht go hAlbain, an áit ina rugadh mé fhéin, mo dheartháireacha agus mo dheirfiúracha. Bhí an t-ádh linn go raibh deis againn teacht abhaile go hÉirinn i ndiaidh 20 bliain thar lear. Ní raibh an deis chéanna ag go leor daoine eile. Níor éirigh go maith le go leor daoine nuair a d’fhág siad an tír seo. D’obair said go dícheallach, chuir siad airgead i leataobh le haghaidh a gcuid teaghlaigh agus chuidigh siad leis an tír. Nuair a tháinig amanna crua, chaill siad a gcuid post agus a lóistín agus bhí orthu cónaí ar na sráideanna. Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil siad fós le feiceáil ar fud na bailte móra i Sasana. Is mór an náire é don Taoiseach gur fhógair an Rialtas inné go bhfuil €1.3 milliún le baint as na daoine a d’fhág an tír sna 1950í agus 1960í, agus atá ar an ngannchuid i Londain inniu. Is mór an náire é daoibh.

The Taoiseach gives a good talk on jobs, but strip away the rhetoric and take it down to the bone and there is nothing there. He might have got away with this in the first few days and weeks of government, but now it is wearing thin. Yesterday he cut the capital budget by €750 million.

Enterprise Ireland’s budget was cut and the Government went after disposable income. Today the VAT rate and fuel prices have been raised. Taoiseach, you are actively trying to cut jobs.

The 2% hike in VAT will see more businesses put under strain from diminishing consumer spending and more of them will go to the wall. The vicious cycle began by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party of relying on indirect taxation is being continued under the watch of the Government. Not only will this measure be tough for business and jobs, it will disproportionately affect lower income earners who pay more of their income in VAT. The €670 million it is stated this figure will bring in is less than what Sinn Féin proposes to bring in through a wealth tax. We propose to bring in €800 million.

The Government talks about tough choices, but it is not tough to go after a spending tax. It is tough to go after wealth, the vested interests and change the status quo. France has the luxury of wealthy individuals appealing to the government to tax them more, just to be patriotic. In Ireland the wealthiest in society stand behind the Government and ask for the most vulnerable to be taxed more and the Government acquiesces.


One cannot squeeze any more blood from the stone; it is dry.

The VAT rate rise announced today is a mistake. The Minister knows this because it is the argument he made in opposition. This is not to mention the impact the VAT rate rise will have on already struggling Border towns, including in my home county of Donegal. Increasing VAT in the hope it will generate enough cash to reduce the deficit is absolute nonsense. By its nature, it will have a diminishing effect on returns as people spend less. We can already see this happening as VAT returns have collapsed this year. What the Government is doing is attempting to run just to stand still.

I listened to Fianna Fáil speak about the unjustifiable nature of increasing VAT, but let us be clear: the only difference between Fianna Fáil’s VAT plans and those of the Government is 12 months. Fianna Fáil also saw VAT as an easy option. It also drove hard-pressed retailers in Border counties to the wall. It pushed up the cost of living for ordinary people and is no more interested in saving jobs than the Government.


The Government’s attacks on education will do little to help the knowledge economy. The State cannot come out of the crisis without the tools to do so. These tools include a well trained and well educated workforce. By making education the preserve of the elite and allowing an opportunity only for those who can afford it, the Government is not ensuring a workforce for the future. This is what it has done through cuts to capitation grants and in funding for higher education bodies. It has also increased fees by €250, about which I am sure the students are delighted——

It is also abolishing maintenance grants for postgraduate students. The Government is pulling down the shutters on the futures of thousands of young men and women not lucky enough to be born into a wealthy family. In this day and age, in a First World country, I do not know how anyone can stand over this. This is a mantra that is meant to distract people while the Government is holding them upside down and shaking the spare coins out of their pockets with its VAT increases, household charges, water charges and other stealth taxes.

Keeping rates and bands the same means keeping them the same for everyone. Therefore that means that those on €20,000 are treated the same as those on €200,000. That is nothing to be proud of.

We have proposed the abolition of the universal social charge, to be replaced with the income levy, with the lower rate reduced to 1%, while reintroducing the health levy. This would mean that everyone earning under €75,000 would be better off under Sinn Féin’s direct taxation proposals. The Government has failed to do that today. It would also mean 500,000 people being taken out of the tax net.

The Government has claimed that people will come out of this budget with the same take home pay. What it does not say, however, is that when they get home with their pay packets, they will be fleeced by higher bills, charges, stealth taxes and a range of other measures aimed at reducing their disposable income.

The Minister for Finance has announced a tinkering with the universal social charge. I welcome the fact that he has ensured that those earning less than €193 per week will be exempt from the universal social charge. However, does the Taoiseach think it is fair that people earning €193 or €194 a week are still paying this unjust charge? There were 514,000 more people brought into the tax net as a result of the universal social charge. The measures announced today will leave 184,000 of them still in the tax net. These people are paying a regressive charge that is not only damaging their quality of life, but also economic activity in terms of consumption.

To have lifted everyone earning under €15,000 out of the universal social charge would have cost €120 million. Taking everyone out from under the minimum wage would have cost €170 million. Sinn Féin would have abolished it, but even this measure would have been fairer than what the Government has done today.

We look at tax in a different way. We go after wealth, tax breaks and loopholes. Reducing the pension ceiling and capping or standardising pension reliefs would bring in €550 million alone. Halving mortgage interest for landlords would bring in €400 million. The changes that we proposed to capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax would bring in €360 million. This is a strategy that increases revenue without damaging the wider economy.

Flat rate taxes are regressive. The Labour Party seems to have mixed up the definitions of “regressive” and “progressive” since its election manifesto, so I will simplify it for the party. Regressive taxes are unfair and not as productive. If they look it up in the dictionary, they will find it beside property taxes.

Nowhere is the Minister for Finance’s political choice to go after the socially and economically vulnerable more stark than in his decision to levy a flat rate regressive tax on households. A household charge is a stealth tax. The way he has levied it will hit those struggling the hardest. Regardless of income or property size, everyone will pay €100. A family with three children, a mortgage of €1,000 a month, and mounting energy and food bills will pay €100. A wealthy individual, however, who is living in a valuable home with no mortgage, will also pay €100. Perhaps the Taoiseach can tell me how this measure is fair.

Some Government party Members will say it is only €100. They will say that because they have simply no idea what €100 means for a family that is already on the breadline. Add that €100 to increased bills, increase travel costs and cuts in income, as announced yesterday, and we will see what it starts to mean and how it adds up. It is only €100 this year but we know from the programme for Government and the memorandum of understanding that Fianna Fáil negotiated that it is to increase year on year.

What is more distressing is that the Minister for Finance is levying this charge on people, many of whom are in mortgage distress. These people took out huge mortgages, at high interest rates in some cases, and paid massive sums in stamp duty just to own a home. The Minister has done little or nothing for the 100,000 households in mortgage distress. Today he has said he expects them to pay the Government a €100 household charge on top of their bills. It is neither right nor fair.

The Minister has lined up stealth taxes in this budget but I wonder if he has given any thought to their effects. Take motor tax, for example. I know from my own county of Donegal — and it is the same right across rural Ireland, including the west — that people are dependent on cars for transport. We do not have trains in Donegal or public transport networks like other regions. People need their cars to get to work, drop their children to school, take care of relatives and go to the shops. They need their cars to get from A to B. That is thanks to the legacy of bad transport planning by previous governments, which ignored the west. None the less, the Minister has increased motor tax and, in addition, fuel is going to go up. We also know that there is a proposal to examine VRT, resulting more motor taxes when the report comes back next year. Therefore, the driver of a mid-range car can expect a €46 increase in motor tax, and people are angry about it. People in County Donegal will ask whether they are expected to pay €46 more given the roads on which they are travelling, but they already pay €46 nearly every second week to have their shock absorbers fixed due to the potholes. Incidentally, these potholes will not be repaired because the Minister has cut €750 million from the capital budget.

The changes to capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax do not go far enough. Yesterday, the Government attacked child benefit to save €70 million in a full year. When I heard about these cuts I was reminded that last year, Deputy Joan Burton told this house when Fianna Fáil cut child benefit that it was a reflection of how few women were in government and how little power women had. As she is now in government, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, could have gone to her Cabinet and explained that an increase in capital gains tax to 40% would have raised €195 million. In addition, reducing all the capital acquisitions tax thresholds by 25%, while increasing the rate to 35%, would have raised €165 million. In today’s Budget Statement, however, the Minister for Finance has allowed capital gains tax exemptions. If the Minister for Social Protection had been able to convince the Cabinet of the need for these measures, she would have saved the cut to child benefit. She could then have rightly declared that she, as a woman, had wielded considerable political power.

The Minister for Finance has failed to deal with the legacy of Fianna Fáil property reliefs which drove the bubble. He has extended a capital gains holiday for people who choose, once again. to speculate in the property market. He has cut stamp duty for non-residential property from 6% to 2% from midnight. His attitude to property should be compared with his attitude yesterday to young, severely disabled people, whom he told he valued half as much as the day before. He is the same as Fianna Fáil Ministers he condemned last year. He will protect high earners whom he fears will become insolvent, but he will go after the most vulnerable and tell them that he has no choice. He is trying to create speculation in the property market yet again but will not deal with upward-only rent reviews which are destroying businesses and killing jobs. Not dealing with upward-only rent reviews means the State will pay €10 million in rent. The State rents properties that are locked in to upward-only rent reviews totalling €58 million. As late as this morning, the Taoiseach told us that matter was under review. Did the Minister for Finance not give him a copy of his script before the Taoiseach took the Order of Business?

The Taoiseach talks about jobs. I got a message from someone in my own constituency who said he was closing up and jobs would be lost because of upward-only rent reviews. The Taoiseach will probably say that there is nothing he can do about it, but does he know that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is applying the upward-only rent review? That Department is putting that person and others out of a job. Regardless of any legal advice, this State has individuals and businesses tied into upward-only rent reviews. I have a full list of them in my office and will pass them on to the Taoiseach if he wants.

That is something the Taoiseach can deal with straight away, here and now.

There are 100,000 families in serious mortgage distress, but where is the fairness for them in this budget? Almost 70 families are falling into serious mortgage distress every single day. While repossession rates have been low in comparison with other countries, that will not last forever. Some 1,048 families have lost their homes in the last two years, which is 1,048 repossessions too many. Without Government action this number will increase.

The Fine Gael-Labour programme for Government included clear promises on mortgage distress. They promised to direct mortgage providers in receipt of State support to cut their costs, yet today mortgages are more costly than when the Government took office. They promised to make greater use of mortgage interest supplement to support families who cannot meet their mortgage payments. Yesterday, however, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, announced a cut of €22.5 million to this benefit and increased the personal contribution for struggling home owners by up to €572 per year. Despite all the promises made during the election and in the programme for Government, Fine Gael and Labour are now taking the same minimalist approach that was taken by Fianna Fáil. Across the State, thousands of families face sleepless nights wondering how they will pay their mortgage bill next month. They will be faced with choosing between falling into mortgage arrears or buying their children presents for Christmas. They will have watched the budget speech, searching for something that would give them hope, and they will have been bitterly disappointed. They will ask a simple question: if the Government could find €20.7 billion for the banks since taking office, why could it not find anything for them? If it is so easy to bail out the banks comprehensively, why can the Government not provide any support to families at risk of losing their homes?

As it did following the publication of the Keane report in October, the Government has left struggling home owners at the mercy of the banks and saddled tens of thousands of home owners with decades of unsustainable debt. It could have chosen a different course and looked to prioritise maintaining the family home. It could have sought appropriate alternatives to ensure debt sustainability and found a way to ensure that the burden of mortgage distress is shared fairly between the borrowers and lenders.

The approach of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in increasing mortgage interest relief to 30% for first-time buyers who purchased homes between 2004 and 2008 demonstrates that he does not understand the magnitude of the problem. This is the wrong approach as it will assist some but leave many others in continued distress. It is arbitrary, discriminatory and not enough. What about the family which bought a home before 2004, the family which needed to upgrade because of an increase in family size and the family which relocated in search of work? Does your measure assist these struggling mortgage holders? No, it does not.

I am very conscious that the Government has produced the budget we are debating against a backdrop of an intensifying European crisis that could have far-reaching implications for the future of Ireland and for the eurozone. My party leader and I have asked the Government on numerous occasions whether there is a contingency plan in place for dealing with any eventualities arising from the euro crisis. We know other Governments, including the French and Germans, have been developing such plans. Even investment firms in this city are developing such plans and have passed them on to their customers. Nevertheless, each time we raise this issue in the House the Taoiseach tells us he has every confidence in European partners and their ability to stabilise the crisis.

Nobody believes the Taoiseach; not the public, the markets nor this House. I urge the Taoiseach to bring the Opposition parties into Government Buildings to discuss this issue, in confidence if required.

The Government must urgently reassure the public that it is taking this crisis seriously and preparing for all scenarios. The events unfolding in Europe are frightening people. Agreements are being reached between powerful EU member states and Ireland is not even represented at the table. Last week the Taoiseach said clearly he was against further treaty change but this morning, the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, stated that the Government was open to negotiation on treaty change. Where does the Government stand on the issue? Does it support enshrining austerity and recession-inducing budgetary policy into EU treaty law? Does it support giving the European Court of Justice a say in policing member state budgets? Does it support the transfer of fiscal powers from this House to the EU institutions?

Does it support ruling out any private sector involvement in burden sharing in dealing with the currency crisis? I ask these questions because these are the key elements of the proposals that Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel will bring to the EU crisis summit on Friday. These are the demands they will be making. More importantly, these are proposals that will consign this State and its people to a decade of crippling austerity. If agreed this weekend, they will have negative consequences for employment, debt and reducing the deficit. In short, they will undermine everything the Government is claiming to have achieved with this week’s disastrous budget.

What will be the Government’s bottom line in the crisis summit this weekend and does it even have one? What price is the Government willing to accept in exchange for wearing the economic straitjacket being proposed by Sarkozy and Merkel? Will the Taoiseach return from the summit like Albert Reynolds did in 1992 with a bag full of euro gold, hoping the electorate will be bedazzled into accepting treaty changes with long-term and damaging consequences for Ireland and the eurozone? Will this Government agree to changes in the hope of avoiding a referendum, using technical legal arguments to avoid giving the people their say? Some 90 years ago today, one of the Minister for Finance’s predecessors signed a treaty that had far-reaching and negative consequences for the Irish people. Let us hope the Taoiseach does not come back to Ireland after this summit having made the same mistake.

The Government has been softening up the Irish people for months, telling them it had to deliver this budget and it had no other choices. It raised the spectre of the troika and the memorandum of understanding, which the Government indicated it would renegotiate, on every occasion to defend its own economic agenda.


There were choices to be made this week and my party’s pre-budget submission set them out. Our submission chose not to go after ordinary families but to invest in growth and jobs. It chose to cut the high earners in the public sector and tax those who could afford it. The Government claims it could not have implemented such choices but that is untrue. Members of my party have met representatives of the troika and they told us they would accept such choices as long as the main budgetary targets are met.

All of these choices damage the economy and will damage people’s families. Last night a homeless man was found dead in Dublin and it is suspected he died from hypothermia. Does that move the Taoiseach? He is a member of a Government that allows people to die of cold on the streets. Every year after the budget, since I have been elected to the Seanad and Dáil, I leave Leinster House by the Kildare Street entrance. Every Deputy and Senator will know there are two places where homeless people sleep that are within sight of the plinth. I walk past those homeless people and wonder if the budget has changed their life in any way. The answer is always “No”.


With this budget the Taoiseach and his Government are exposed. The Irish people sat in judgment of Fianna Fáil and I promise the Taoiseach they will judge Fine Gael and Labour the same way.
