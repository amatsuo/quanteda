\title{compute tf-idf weights from a dfm}
\usage{
tfidf(x, ...)

\method{tfidf}{dfm}(x, normalize = TRUE, smoothing = 0L, ...)

idf(x, k = 1, USE.NAMES = TRUE, base = 10)

\method{idf}{dfm}(x, k = 1, USE.NAMES = TRUE, base = 10)

tf(x)

\S4method{tf}{dfmSparse}(x)

\S4method{tf}{dfmDense}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object for which idf or tf-idf will be computed (a document-feature 
matrix)}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link{idf}} when calling
\code{tdidf}}

\item{normalize}{if \code{TRUE}, use relative term frequency}

\item{smoothing}{amount to apply as additive smoothing to the 
document-feature matrix prior to weighting, default is \code{0} for no 
smoothing.  Another sensible value would be 0.5.}

\item{k}{additional constant to add to the denominator in \emph{idf} 
computation, default is \code{k = 1}}

\item{USE.NAMES}{logical; if \code{TRUE} attach feature labels as names of 
the resulting numeric vector}

\item{base}{the base with respect to which logarithms in \emph{idf}
computation are computed, default is 10 (see Manning, Raghavan, and Schutze
2008, p123).}
}
\description{
Compute tf-idf, inverse document frequency, and relative term frequency on 
document-feature matrices.  See also \code{\link{weight}}.
}
\details{
\code{tfidf} computes term frequency-inverse document frequency 
  weighting.  The default is to normalize term frequency (by computing 
  relative term frequency within document) but this is not performed if 
  \code{normalize = FALSE}.

\code{idf} computes inverse document frequency with a constant 
  \code{k} added to the denominator of log document frequency.

\code{tf} is a shortcut to compute relative term frequecies (identical to 
\code{\link{weight}(x, "relFreq")}).
