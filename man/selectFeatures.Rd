\usage{
selectFeatures(x, features, ...)

\method{selectFeatures}{dfm}(x, features = NULL, selection = c("keep",
  "remove"), valuetype = c("glob", "regex", "fixed"), verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object whose features will be selected}

\item{features}{character vector of \link[regex]{regular expressions}
definding the features to be selected, or a dictionary class object whose
values will provide the features to be selected.  If a dictionary class
object, the values will be interpreted as regular expressions.  (We may add
the option for other formats in the next revision.)}

\item{...}{supplementary arguments passed to the underlying functions in
\code{\link[stringi]{stri_detect_regex}}, such as \code{case_insensitive}}

\item{selection}{whether to keep or remove the features}

\item{valuetype}{how to interpret feature vector: \code{fixed} for words as
is; \code{"regex"} for regular expressions; or \code{"glob"} for
"glob"-style wildcard}

\item{verbose}{if \code{TRUE} print message about how many features were
removed}
}
\description{
This function selects or discards features from a dfm.variety of objects,
such as text, a dfm, or a list of collocations.  The most common usage for
\code{removeFeatures} will be to eliminate stop words from a text or
text-based object, or to select only features from a list of regular
expression.
