\title{plot a fitted wordfish model}
\usage{
\method{plot}{textmodel_wordfish_fitted}(x, type = c("docs", "feats"),
  doclabels = NULL, sort = TRUE, left.mar = 8, pickout = NULL,
  alpha = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{for plot method, the object to be plotted}

\item{type}{\code{docs} to plot document scores (the default) or \code{feats}
to plot psi against beta parameters}

\item{doclabels}{a vector of names for document. If left NULL (the default),
ordinary document names will be used.}

\item{sort}{If TRUE (the default), order points from low to high score. If a
vector, order according to these values from low to high. Only applies when
\code{type} is 'docs'}

\item{left.mar}{an overridden left margin, passed to \code{par} (default
8.1). This overrides R's default 4.1, which is typically too cramped for
document names.}

\item{pickout}{A vector of feature names to draw attention to in a feature
plot. Only applies if \code{type} is 'feats'}

\item{alpha}{A number between 0 and 1 (default 0.5) representing the level of
alpha transparency used to overplot feature names in a feature plot. Only
applies if \code{type} is 'feats'.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{\link{plot}}}
}
\description{
Plot a fitted wordfish model, either as an ideal point-style plot (theta plus
confidence interval on the x-axis, document labels on the y) with optional
renaming and sorting, or as a plot of estimated feature-level parameters (beta on the x, psi on the
y, feature names over-plotted with alpha transparency, optionally some
highlighted) as in Slapin and Proksch, 2008.

postwar <- dfm_trim(dfm(data_corpus_inaugural[41:57]), min_count = 5, min_docfreq = 2)
mod <- textmodel(postwar, model = "wordfish")
plot(mod, sort = FALSE)
plot(mod, sort = TRUE)
plot(mod, type = "feats", pickout = c("government", "countries", "children", 
     "the", "nuclear", "federal"))
