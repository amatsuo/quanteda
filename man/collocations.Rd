\title{Detect collocations from text}
\usage{
collocations(x, ...)

\method{collocations}{character}(x, method = c("all", "lr", "chi2"), n = 2,
  top = NULL, ...)

\method{collocations}{corpus}(x, method = c("all", "lr", "chi2"), n = 2,
  top = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a text, a character vector of texts, or a corpus}

\item{...}{additional parameters}

\item{method}{association measure for detecting collocations.  \code{all} returns
all available measures, \code{lr} returns the likelihood ratio statistic \eqn{G^2},
and \code{chi2} returns Pearson's \eqn{\chi^2} statistic.}

\item{n}{length of the collocation.  Only bigrams (\code{n=2}) implemented so far.}

\item{top}{the number of collocations to return, sorted in descending order of the
requested statistic, or \eqn{G^2} if none is specified.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of collocations, their frequencies, and the computed
association measure.
}
\description{
Detects collocations (currently, bigrams) from texts or a corpus, returning a
data.frame of collocations and their scores, sorted by the likelihood
ratio \eqn{G^2} and Pearson's \eqn{\chi^2}.
}
\examples{
collocations(inaugTexts, top=10)
collocations(inaugCorpus, top=10, method="chi2")
}
