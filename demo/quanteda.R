# The main demo file for quanteda

# The title "quanteda-demo.R" doesn't work, the hyphen isn't parsed correctly, hence the camelCase

# this can be called with demo(quantedaDemo, package="quanteda"), or just demo(quantedaDemo) as there is no other package with that topic.

# other files in this folder can contain specific topic demos which can be called with demo(topic)
