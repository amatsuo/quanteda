	Abstract = {Stemming is a pre-processing step in Text Mining applications as well as a very common requirement of Natural Language processing functions. In fact it is very important in most of the Information Retrieval systems. The main purpose of stemming is to reduce different grammatical forms / word forms of a word like its noun, adjective, verb, adverb etc. to its root form. We can say that the goal of stemming is to reduce inflectional forms and sometimes derivationally related forms of a word to a common base form. In this paper we have discussed different methods of stemming and their comparisons in terms of usage, advantages as well as limitations. The basic difference between stemming and lemmatization is also discussed.},

@article{HopkinsKing2010,
	Abstract = {We develop a method of automated content analysis that gives approximately unbiased estimates of quantities of theoretical interest to social scientists. With a small sample of documents hand coded into investigator-chosen categories, our method can give accurate estimates of the proportion of documents in each category in a larger population. Existing methods allow for the possibility of substantial bias in estimating the category proportions that are often of interest to social scientists. We first show how to correct the bias for any existing classifier, and then go further to estimate the proportions without the intermediate step of individual document classification and with greatly reduced assumptions. We also introduce a statistical correction for the less-than-perfect levels of inter-coder reliability that typically characterize human document classification. These methods allow us to measure the classical conception of public opinion as those views that are actively and publicly expressed, rather than the attitudes or non-attitudes of the populace as a whole. Specifically, we track the daily opinions of thousands of people about President Bush using a massive data set of online blogs we develop and make available with this article. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements our methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness with several other text categorization problems.

	Abstract = {In a recent article in the American Political Science Review, Laver, Benoit, and Garry (2003, 'Extracting policy positions from political texts using words as data,' 97:311--331) propose a new method for conducting content analysis. Their Wordscores approach, by automating text-coding procedures, represents an advance in content analysis that will potentially have a large long-term impact on research across the discipline. To allow substantive interpretation, the scores produced by the Wordscores procedure require transformation. In this note, we address several shortcomings in the transformation procedure introduced in the original program. We demonstrate that the original transformation distorts the metric on which content scores are placed---hindering the ability of scholars to make meaningful comparisons across texts---and that it is very sensitive to the texts that are scored---opening up the possibility that researchers may generate, inadvertently or not, results that depend on the texts they choose to include in their analyses. We propose a transformation procedure that solves these problems.

	Abstract = {Recent advances in computational methods for extracting party positions from political texts have provided scholars promising new ways for estimating party positions. However, existing methods face serious challenges when it comes to producing time-series data. This leaves a gap in the literature on estimating party ideology. We fill this gap by proposing a scaling technique to estimate positions based on word frequencies in political texts. Our technique allows researchers to locate parties in one or multiple elections. We estimate the positions of German political parties from 1990-2005 from word frequencies in party manifestos. The extracted positions reflect changes in the party system more accurately than existing time-series positions. Our method allows us to examine which words are important for placing parties on the left and the right. We find that words with strong political connotations are the best discriminators between parties. Finally, we include a series of robustness checks and demonstrate that our positions are insensitive to distributional assumptions and document selection.},

@unpublished{Elff2008,
	Abstract = {The reconstruction of political positions of parties, candidates and governments has 
made considerable headway during the last decades, not the least due to the efforts 
of the Manifesto Research Group the and Comparative Manifestos Project, which compiled 
and published a data set on the electoral platforms of political parties from most 
major democracies for most of the post-war era. A central assumption underlying 
the coding of electoral platforms into quantitative data as done by the MRG/CMP is 
that parties take positions by selective emphases of policy objectives, which put their 
accomplishments in a most positive light (Budge 2001) or are representative for their 
current polital/ideological positions. Consequently, the MRG/CMP data consist of 
percentages of the respective manifesto texts that refer to various policy objectives. 
As a consequence both of this underlying assumption and of the structure of the 
CMP data, methods of classical multivariate analysis are not well suited to these data, 
due to the requirements to the data for an appropriate application of these methods 
(van der Brug 2001; Elff 2002). The paper offers an alternative method for reconstructing 
positions in political spaces based on latent trait modelling, which both reflects the 
assumptions underlying the coding of the texts and the peculiar structure of the 
data. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated with respect to 
the average position of party families within reconstructed policy spaces. It turns out 
that communist, socialist, and social democrat parties differ clearly from ``bourgeois'' 
parties with regards to their positions on an economic left/right dimension, while 
British and Scandinavian conservative parties can be distinguished from Christian 
democratic parties by their respective positions on a libertarian/authoritarian and a 
traditionalist/modernist dimension. Similarly, the typical political positions of green (or 
``New Politics'') parties can be distinguished from the positions of other party families. },

	Abstract = {There are several perspectives on voting behavior that usually constitute separate strands of research: the impact of social background on vote choice, the relation between policy positions of parties and policy preferences of voters, and the effect of party platforms on the electoral success of parties. Although they all apply to the same entities, that is, to voters and parties, these different perspectives seem to have divergent implications. Thus we are in need of a way to reconcile these perspectives.

The empirical results presented in this paper suggest a way what such a reconciliation should look like. They could be summarized as follows: In party platforms, several ideological dimensions can be distinguished that are connected with different cleavages in the Lispet-Rokkan sense. Second, it is shown that individuals from different social groups differ in the way they evaluate party platforms and choose among parties. Third, the way these individuals evaluate party platforms conforms to spatial notions of voting. Fourth, a general pattern of platform evaluation established on the base of pooled data of several countries accounts to a large degree for differences between levels of religious voting in these countries.},

	Abstract = {The analysis of parliamentary debates is at the confluence of a number of develop- 
ments in political science. What light can automated and semi-automated techniques 
throw on such analysis? In this paper we compare two such approaches, one semi-automated (Hamlet) and the other fully automated (Alceste). We use both approaches to 
identify the prominent themes in debate and to assess how far speakers who favour different positions adopt a distinct pattern of discourse. We seek to assess how far the two approaches yield convergent or divergent analyses. Selecting a second reading debate from the UK House of Commons on a private member's bill on abortion in July 1966, we are able to show similarities of analysis despite the detailed differences between the two approaches. In particular, the analysis in Hamlet allows identification of the extent to which individual speakers employ one type of vocabulary rather than another. Alceste is able to provide a statistical basis for the different classes of vocabulary that occur in the debate.

While exponential change may be expected as new bits of information are added, adding new words does not always correspond to new information. Essentially as a result of its independence assumption, the estimates grow too quickly. We investigate one parametric family that attempts to downweight the growth rate. The parameters of this family are estimated using a maximum likelihood scheme, and the results are evaluated.},

	Abstract = {Parties, candidates, and voters are becoming increasingly engaged in political conversations through the micro-blogging platform Twitter. In this paper I show that the structure of the social networks in which they are embedded has the poten- tial to become a source of information about policy positions. Under the assumption that social networks are homophilic (McPherson et al., 2001), this is, the propensity of users to cluster along partisan lines, I develop a Bayesian Spatial Following model that scales Twitter users along a common ideological dimension based on who they follow. I apply this network-based method to estimate ideal points for Twitter users in the US, the UK, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. The resulting positions of the party accounts on Twitter are highly correlated with offline measures based on their voting records and their manifestos. Similarly, this method is able to successfully classify individuals who state their political orientation publicly, and a sample of users from the state of Ohio whose Twitter accounts are matched with their voter registration history. To illustrate the potential contribution of these estimates, I examine the extent to which online behavior is polarized along ideological lines. Us- ing the 2012 US presidential election campaign as a case study, I find that public exchanges on Twitter take place predominantly among users with similar viewpoints.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we discuss the design of party classifiers for Congressional speech data. We then examine these party classifiers' person-dependency and time-dependency. We found that party classifiers trained on 2005 House speeches can be generalized to the Senate speeches of the same year, but not vice versa. The classifiers trained on 2005 House speeches performed better on Senate speeches from recent years than on older ones, which indicates the classifiers' time-dependency. This dependency may be caused by changes in the issue agenda or the ideological composition of Congress.},

	Abstract = {Recent research has shown that, in several countries, the Com- 
parative Manifesto Pro ject (CMP) measures of party positions do not seem 
to perform well in terms of face validity and reliability. A fairly typical ex- 
ample of such a deviant case is that of Greece, where for the most part the 
findings based on this approach seem to suggest that parties' positions are 
characterised by extreme discontinuity and leapfrogging. Employing a differ- 
ent coding methodology whose departure point is that party competition is 
still a matter of direct confrontation between parties, this analysis attempts 
to measure the positions of Greek parties on three issue dimensions: level of 
state intervention in the economy, support toward the political integration of 
the EU, and common European cultural identity. According to its findings, 
the traditional left-right distinction is still evident in parties' economic stances 
whereas the other two issue dimensions indicate that there is an emerging new- 
politics dimension which distinguishes between the centripetal political forces 
on the one hand and the radical right and left parties on the other. Impor- 
tantly, this relatively new coding procedure seems to provide estimates which 
outperform those stemming from the CMP data both in terms of reliability 
and face validity.},

@article{BudgePennings2007,
	Abstract = {Policy scorings of political actors are crucially important in operationalising rational choice models and other important theories 
in political science. Doing them more cheaply and quickly by computer is important for the advancement of the discipline. But we 
can hardly substitute these for hand-coding or even use them in new fields without being sure of their validity and reliability. We 
check this by comparing the mappings produced by word frequency methods with the policy series available from the work of the 
Manifesto Research Group/Comparative Manifesto Project (MRG/CMP). Using an aggregate calibrating/reference `document set' 
for the time period in question evades reliability problems with pairwise comparisons and provides an authoritative text which 
enables individual party platforms to be scored and mapped over long time periods. Comparisons of the techniques for two countries (US and UK) are not encouraging. Wordscores in their current operationalisation flatten out party movement just as previous computerised approaches have done. Sensitivity testing with British party manifestos 1979e1997, using an expert scoring, does not 
reveal any improvement in performance. The reliability problems which arise with policy series are also likely to recur with cross-sectional applications of the word frequency approach.  },

This computerized content analysis technique is a potentially powerful tool for scholars interested in the study of political elites, since it promises an easy and efficient way of inferring policy position from texts and speeches. In this article, we provide a systematic evaluation of this promising method. Using Danish manifestos and government speeches from 1945 to 2005, we compare the policy positions extracted using Wordscores with measures of positions from the well-known Comparative Manifesto Project and cross-validate these with party expert surveys. Our analysis shows that the word scoring technique arrives at largely similar estimates to independently derived position measures and produces time series of government positions with high face validity.},

	Abstract = {We develop a computer-assisted method for the discovery of insightful conceptualizations, in the form of clusterings of input objects. Each of the numerous fully automated methods of cluster analysis proposed in statistics, computer science, and biology optimize a different objective function. Almost all are well defined, but how to determine ex ante which one, if any, will partition a given set of objects in an ``insightful'' or ``useful'' way for a given user is unknown and difficult, if not logically impossible. We develop a metric space of partitions from all existing cluster analysis methods applied to a given data set (along with millions of other solutions we add based on combinations of existing clusterings), and enable a user to explore and interact with it, and quickly reveal or prompt useful or insightful conceptualizations. In addition, although uncommon in unsupervised learning problems, we offer and implement evaluation designs that make our computer-assisted approach vulnerable to being proven suboptimal in specific data types. We demonstrate that our approach facilitates more efficient and insightful discovery of useful information than either expert human coders or many existing fully automated methods. We (will) make available an easy-to-use software package that implements all our suggestions.},

	Abstract = {This article looks at the voting behaviour of Members of the European Parliament in the first year of the 1999--2004 European Parliament. The research applies the Nominate scaling method (developed to map voting in the US Congress) to the 1,031 `roll-call votes' in the EP in this period. This method enables us to locate each MEP in a multi-dimensional policy space, and to plot a `cutting line' for each vote. From this information we find that legislative behaviour in the EP is mainly along left--right lines, transnational party group affiliation is more important than national affiliation for deter- mining how MEPs vote, different majority-commanding coalitions form on different issues, and the difference between the simple majority and absolute majority rules has no effect on the voting behaviour of the two main party groups.},

	Abstract = {We develop a scaling model to estimate U.S. Supreme Court opinion locations and justice ideal points along a common spatial dimension using data derived from the citations between opinions. Citations from new opinions to precedent opinions usually apply and endorse the doctrine of the precedent opinion; however, sometimes they implicitly or explicitly dispute the precedent opinion. We collect original datasets classifying citations from search and seizure and freedom of religion opinions written between 1953 and 2006 into these different types and develop a model relating the similarity of the doctrine embodied in the citing and cited opinions to the relative probability of these different types of citations. The resulting spatial estimates of opinion location are used to evaluate theories of Supreme Court bargaining and opinion writing. We find empirical support for theoretical models that predict the majority opinion will fall at the ideal point of the median member of the majority coalition. Given the centrality of theories of judicial policymaking to various substantive problems in political science, the method of scaling opinions developed in this article can facilitate a range of future research.},

A set of l observed vectors Y are available at a single unknown X and it is desired to draw inferences about this unknown vector X. In order to do this calibrating data is available jointly on (Y,X) where two situations are distinguished (i), X is controlled, (ii) X is random. Using orthodox sampling theory on the one hand and Bayesian methods on the other hand point estimators and confidence regions are derived and contrasted. A procedure for selection of a subset of responses is given. Finally a comparison is made of the methods on data from (a) a random calibration experiment of wheat quality using an infrared spectrometer and (b) a controlled experiment of point finish.

	Abstract = {Scholars often use roll-call votes to study legislative behaviour. However, many legislatures only conclude a minority of decisions by roll call. Thus, if these votes are not a random sample of the universe of votes cast, scholars may be drawing misleading inferences. In fact, theories over why roll-call votes are requested would predict selection bias based on exactly the characteristics of legislative voting that scholars have most heavily studied. This article demonstrates the character and severity of this sampling problem empirically by examining European Parliament vote data for a whole year. Given that many legislatures decided only a fraction of their legislation by roll call, these findings have potentially important implications for the general study of legislative behaviour.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of political communication is an important aspect of political research. Thematic content analysis has yielded considerable success both with manual and automatic coding, but Semantic Network Analysis has proven more difficult, both for humans and for the computer. This article presents a system for an automated Semantic Network Analysis of Dutch texts. The system automatically extracts relations between political actors based on the output of syntactic analysis of Dutch newspaper articles. Specifically, the system uses pattern matching to find source constructions and determine the semantic agent and patient of relations, and name matching and anaphora resolution to identify political actors. The performance of the system is judged by comparing the extracted relations to manual codings of the same material. Results on the level of measurement indicate acceptable performance. We also estimate performance at the levels of analysis by using a case study of media authority, resulting in good correlations between the theoretical variables derived from the automatic and manual analysis. Finally, we test a number of substantive hypotheses with regression models using the automatic and manual output, resulting in highly similar models in each case. This suggests that our method has sufficient performance to be used to answer relevant political questions in a valid way.

	Abstract = {This article examines how national parties position themselves in European Parliament (EP) speeches. We apply a new computer-based content analysis technique, Wordfish, to estimate party positions in the European Parliament using the word counts in speeches. We test three hypotheses of position-taking in the European Parliament: a left-right ideology hypothesis, a pro/anti-Europe hypothesis, and a national politics hypothesis. Surprisingly, and in contrast to studies of roll call votes, we do not find evidence that national party positions from MEP speeches reflect the parties' overall left-right ideology. Instead, these positions reflect the parties' stance with regard to EU integration and national redistributive characteristics. We test the robustness of our results in a threefold manner. First, we take advantage of the multilingual environment of the European Parliament and show that the estimated positions are robust to the choice of translation (English, French, and German). Second, we use independent measures of national party positions from analyses of roll call votes and two expert surveys. Finally, we apply a range of statistical models to account for measurement error of the independent variables and the hierarchical structure of the data. Our robust findings suggest that the entire corpus of EP speeches reflects partisan divisions over EU integration rather than left-right politics.},

@article{GabelHuber2000,
	Abstract = {The left-right ideological positions of political parties play a central role in theorizing about many different aspects of democratic processes. Unfortunately, scholars are hindered in their ability to test existing theories by the limited availability of data that is comparable over time and across countries. This paper describes a simple 'vanilla' method for using manifestos data to estimate party left-right positions. It then tests this method and four existing ones by regressing a variety of accepted survey-based measures of left-right party positions on the estimates of party positions generated by the various techniques. Finally, analysis of the residuals from these regressions identifies the extent to which there are systematic sources of errors in using manifestos data to estimate party left-right positions. The vanilla method consistently produces the best estimates of party positions, and these estimates are quite good (less than one point, on average, from the estimates of other accepted approaches). Manifestos data, however, tend to locate extreme parties closer to the ideological center than do other survey-based approaches.},

	Abstract = {Politics and political conflict often occur in the written and spoken word. Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods-- they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

	Abstract = {Automated content analysis is employed to measure the dimensionality of Senate debates on the 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and compare these results with the final vote. The underlying verbal conflict leading up to the final roll-call vote contains two important dimensions: (1) an emotive battle over the abortion procedure itself, and (2) the battle over the constitutionality of the bill. Surprisingly, senators appear not to have voted along the first dimension of the verbal conflict, but rather along the second dimension. The analysis of the deliberations of senators not only enables us to understand the complexity of the arguments that is not captured in the vote, but it also uncovers (and measures empirically) the strategies employed by legislators to shape the relevant lines of conflict, and ultimately, the final content of the bill.},

This article suggests that the issue context is an important source of variation because it can facilitate or hamper the ability of interest groups to lobby decision-makers successfully. In order to test the effect of issue characteristics, this article draws on a new, unprecedented data set of interest group lobbying in the European Union. Using quantitative text analysis to analyse Commission consultations, this article studies lobbying success across 2696 interest groups and 56 policy issues. The findings indicate that lobbying success indeed varies with the issue context, depending on the relative size of lobbying coalitions and the salience of policy issues, whereas individual group characteristics do not exhibit any systematic effect.},

@article{PenningsKeman2002,
	Abstract = {In the last twenty years, an international group of political scientists has coded nearly 2000 party manifestos with the help of one single coding scheme based on 56 categories which covers all main topics of these documents. However, there is a growing awareness of the shortcomings of the underlying coding scheme, such as overlapping and missing categories, which cannot be repaired without coding all manifestos all over again. Some have presented an alternative for manifesto-research by means of expert opinions on party policy positions, but these are unable to provide reliable time series for subsequent election years. The unborn solution to some of the problems with the coding scheme would be the computerised content analysis on digitalised party manifestos. This would open up a new universe of infinite possibilities for recodings and reanalyses. The extended consequences from full computerisation of textual analysis are mind boggling. But at the present, these possibilities are merely potentials as the computerised techniques are still underdeveloped. This article explores the possibilities for computerised content analysis in such a way that all postwar manifestos in established democracies can be compared with each other with the help of flexible coding schemes.},

	Abstract = {This paper shows how legislators' written and spoken text can be used to ideologically scale individuals even in the absence of informative votes, by positioning members according to their similarity to two reference texts constructed from the aggregated speech of every member of each of two major parties. The paper develops a new Bayesian scaling that is more theoretically sound that the related Wordscores approach, and a new vector-based scaling that works better than either at matching the vote-based scaling DW-Nominate in the US Senate. Unsupervised methods such as Wordfish or principal component analysis are found to do less well. Once validated in the US context, this approach is then tested in a legislature without informative voting, the UK House of Commons. There the scalings successfully separate members of different parties, order parties correctly, match expert and rebellion-based scalings reasonably well, and work across different years and even changes in leadership. The text-based scaling developed here both matches existent scalings fairly well, and may be a much more accurate window into the true ideological positions of political actors in legislatures and the many other domains where textual data are plentiful.},

This Note focuses on the validity of the resulting estimates, particularly of the massive policy time-series assembled by the Manifesto Research Group (MRG) of the European Consortium. These are important not only for the policy measurements they provide for fifty post-war democracies, but also from the point of view of validating other codings of texts, especially those deriving from computerized analyses. No other validating standard is available for any but a handful of post-war elections -- certainly none other that so unambiguously measures policy preferences as opposed to actual party behaviour and which itself has been so well established by extensive use.

	Abstract = {Verbal autopsy procedures are widely used for estimating cause-specific mortality in areas without medical death certification. Data on symptoms reported by caregivers along with the cause of death are collected from a medical facility, and the cause-of-death distribution is estimated in the population where only symptom data are available. Current approaches analyze only one cause at a time, involve assumptions judged difficult or impossible to satisfy, and require expensive, time consuming, or unreliable physician reviews, expert algorithms, or parametric statistical models. By generalizing current approaches to analyze multiple causes, we show how most of the difficult assumptions underlying existing methods can be dropped. These generalizations also make physician review, expert algorithms, and parametric statistical assumptions unnecessary. With theoretical results, and empirical analyses in data from China and Tanzania, we illustrate the accuracy of this approach. While no method of analyzing verbal autopsy data, including the more computationally intensive approach offered here, can give accurate estimates in all circumstances, the procedure offered is conceptually simpler, less expensive, more general, as or more replicable, and easier to use in practice than existing approaches. We also show how our focus on estimating aggregate proportions, which are the quantities of primary interest in verbal autopsy studies, may also greatly reduce the assumptions necessary, and thus improve the performance of, many individual classifiers in this and other areas. As a companion to this paper, we also offer easy-to-use software that implements the methods discussed herein. },

@unpublished{benoitnulty:2013,
	Abstract = {Quantitative methods for scaling latent political traits have much in common with super- vised machine learning methods commonly applied to tasks such as email spam detection and product recommender systems. Despite commonalities, however, the research goals and philosophical underpinnings are quite different: machine learning is usually concerned with predicting a knowable or known class, most often with a practical application in mind. Estimating political traits through text, by contrast, involves measuring latent quantities that are inherently unobservable through direct means, and where human ``verification'' is unreliable, prohibitively costly, or otherwise unavailable. In this paper we show that not only can the Naive Bayes classifier, one of the most widely used machine learning classi- fication methods, can be successfully adapted to measuring latent traits, and also that it is equivalent in general form to Laver, Benoit and Garry (2003)'s ``Wordscores'' algorithm for measuring policy positions. We revisit several prominent applications of Wordscores refor- mulated as Naive Bayes, demonstrating the equivalence but also revealing areas where the original Wordscores algorithm can be substantially improved using standard techniques from machine learning. From this we issue some concrete recommendations for future applications of supervised machine learning to scale latent political traits.},
