
THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS

GETTING THE NATION WORKING

    'THE CRUCIAL QUESTION FACING YOU ON NOVEMBER 25TH IS: WHAT 
KIND OF GOVERNMENT DO YOU WANT FOR THIS COUNTRY?

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS HAVE PROVED WE CAN MAKE A VALUABLE 
CONTRIBUTION TO GOVERNMENT. WE ARE NOW PUTTING MANY FRESH 
AND CHALLENGING PLANS BEFORE THE PEOPLE IN THIS CAMPAIGN.

WE WANT MORE DEPUTIES IN THE NEXT DAIL, TO ACHIEVE EVEN MORE IN 
THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE. WHAT FOLLOWS IS A SUMMARY OF SOME 
OF OUR MAIN PROPOSALS. WITH YOUR SUPPORT, WE CAN CONTINUE TO 
CHANGE THE FACE OF IRISH POLITIES FOR THE BETTER.'

                             DES O'MALLEY

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS

GETTING THE NATION WORKING

IN 1987 THE MAJOR PROBLEM FACING THIS COUNTRY WAS THE IMMINENT 
THREAT OF NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY. THE PUBLIC FINANCES WERE RUNNING 
OUT OF CONTROL AND ECONOMIC CHAOS WAS LOOMING. THAT CRISIS WAS 
AFFECTIVELY TACKLED THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STRONG AND 
DECISIVE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT POLICIES, MOST NOTABLY DURING OUR 
PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST THREE-AND-A-HALF YEARS.

NOW OUR COUNTRY IS CONFRONTED BY A NEW CRISIS-THE URGENT NEED 
TO PROTECT AND CREATE JOBS. THE SHARP DOWNTURN IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY HAS HIT ALL COUNTRIES HARD. FOR IRELAND THE 
SITUATION HAS BEEN COMPOUNDED BY THE RECENT COLLAPSE IN THE 
VALUE OF STERLING.

WE IN THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THE JOBS CRISIS CAN 
BE RESOLVED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF IMMEDIATE MEASURES TO AID 
JOB CREATION, COMBINED WITH THE CONTINUATION OF OUR PROGRAMME 
OF TAX REFORM AND FRESH INITIATIVES TO BOOST ENTERPRISE.

JOB CREATION 
IN THE SHORT TERM, STRONG AND DECISIVE ACTION IS URGENTLY NEEDED 
TO CONFRONT THE JOBS CRISIS. WE IN THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ARE 
PROPOSING A SERIES OF IMAGINATIVE MEASURES TO RESTORE 
CONFIDENCE, PROTECT EXISTING JOBS, BOOST EMPLOYMENT, AND 
PREVENT THE COUNTRY FROM SLIDING FURTHER INTO RECESSION.

1   IN ORDER TO ENSURE A SPEEDY REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATES, AND 
REDUCE THE CRIPPLINGBURDEN CURRENTLY AFFECTING HOUSEHOLDERS WITH 
MORTGAGES, AND BUSINESSES, WE WILL:

(A) MAINTAIN A FIRM COMMITMENT TO THE FISCAL DISCIPLINES REQUIRED 
FOR IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION IN MONETARY UNION (EMU).
(B) REPLACE HIGH INTEREST RATE IRISH BORROWING WITH LOW INTEREST 
RATES OVERSEAS BORROWINGS.

THIS WILL INJECT LIQUIDITY INTO THE IRISH MONEY MARKET, BRINGING 
DOWN INTEREST RATES. THIS WOULD ALSO ACT AS A STRONG SIGNAL TO 
OVERSEAS INVESTORS THAT THE IRISH POUND WILL NOT BE DEVALUED, AND 
THAT IN TURN WILL FURTHER HELP THE INTEREST RATE SITUATION IN IRELAND.

2  FURTHER ACTION TO AID EXPORTERS AFFECTED BY THE FALL IN STERLING. 
THE £50M. MARKET DEVELOPMENT FUND INTRODUCED BY DES 
O'MALLEY HAS PROVIDED IMMEDIATE SUPPORT
FOR 50,000 JOBS IN FIRMS HEAVILY RELIANT ON THE BRITISH MARKET. 
WHERE NECESSARY, THIS WILL BE REINFORCED BY TAX CHANGES, 
INCLUDING A POSSIBLE CUT IN EMPLOYERS' PRSI, OR OTHER SPECIAL 
MEASURES TO ENSURE THE LONGER-TERM COMPETITIVENESS OF IRISH 
BUSINESS.

3 A SUSTAINED FIVE-YEAR PROGRAMME TO CREATE EMPLOYMENT; THIS 
WILL INVOLVE PRIORITY USE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL EC FUNDS WHICH WILL 
FLOW INTO IRELAND AS PART OF THE MAASTRICHT PROCESS, AS WELL AS 
FURTHER TAX REFORM AND FRESH JOB CREATION INITIATIVES

4 A MAJOR PROGRAMME OF INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT, WITH 
IMMEDIATE MOVES TO ACTIVATE A STRONG AND EFFICIENT NATIONAL 
ROADS AUTHORITY, WITH SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATION. 
THE AIM WILL BE TO SUBSTANTIALLY BOOST SPENDING ON NATIONAL ROADS 
BY ATTRACTING IN PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCING AND SECURING A 
CONSEQUENT INCREASE IN THE FUNDING AVAILABLE FROM THE EC.

WITH THESE MEASURES, WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE CAN BE PUT BACK TO 
WORK IN SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS AND THAT CONFIDENCE CAN BE RESTORED 
TO THE IRISH ECONOMY

TAX REFORM 
IRELAND CONTINUES TO HAVE THE MOST PENAL ANTI-WORK TAX SYSTEM IN 
THE WESTERN WORLD. THIS PUTS US AS A NATION AT A SEVERE 
DISADVANTAGE IN COMPETING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES FOR PROJECTS WITH 
A MAJOR EMPLOYMENT CONTENT. THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS REMAIN 
COMMITTED TO A SUBSTANTIAL PROGRAMME OF PRO-JOBS TAX REFORM, TO 
BE WORKED TOWARDS OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD, AND BEARING IN MIND 
OVERALL BUDGETARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE MAIN FEATURES OF OUR TAX REFORM PROPOSALS ARE:

A STANDARD TAX RATE OF 25%
A WIDENING OF THE STANDARD RATE BAND UP TO THE AVERAGE INDUSTRIAL 
WAGE 
AN UPPER TAX RATE OF 40%
A REFORM AND SIMPLIFICATION OF THE PRSI SYSTEM.

THESE MEASURES WILL, OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD, RESULT IN A TAX 
SYSTEM THAT FAVOURS WORK AND ENTERPRISE. THIS RADICAL OVERHAUL 
WILL BE FUNDED IN PART BY IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES IN THE TAX 
COLLECTION SYSTEM TO EFFECTIVELY TACKLE THE BLACK ECONOMY, AND BY 
REFORM OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM. WE ARE FIRMLY COMMITTED TO THE 
RETENTION OF MORTGAGE INTEREST RELIEF. THE GENERAL THRUST OF OUR 
POLICIES WILL BE TO FOCUS TAX-BREAKS ON THOSE WITH THE LOWEST 
INCOMES.

THE IRISH TAX SYSTEM IS NOW STRONGLY BIASED IN FAVOUR OF BANK 
DEPOSITS AND AGAINST JOB-CREATING INVESTMENT. WE WILL UNDERTAKE 
AN URGENT REVIEW OF THE TAX TREATMENT OF INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, 
AND THE CAPITAL TAXES REGIME IN PARTICULAR. OUR OBJECTIVE IS THE 
ELIMINATION OF THE CURRENT DISINCENTIVES TO INVESTMENT.

LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT

NO MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL THESE INITIATIVES PROVE IN GENERATING 
NEW EMPLOYMENT IN SUSTAINING EXISTING JOBS, THE SAD REALITY IS 
THAT THE UNDERLYING SCALE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, ALONG WITH THE FACT 
THAT UP TO 25,000 ADDITIONAL PEOPLE JOIN THE WORKFORCE EVERY 
YEAR, MEANS THAT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME WE WILL HAVE A MAJOR 
UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS IN IRELAND.

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS PROPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A 
NATIONAL COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT SCHEME MODELLED ON THE 
EXISTING SOCIAL EMPLOYMENT SCHEMES, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE 
THREE DAYS WORK EACH WEEK. INITIAL PRIORITY WOULD BE GIVEN TO THE 
100,000 PLUS LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED.

THERE IS SO MUCH WORK TO DO-COMMUNITY AND ENVIRONMENT 
PROJECTS; HOME HELP SERVICES; SPORTING, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL 
ORGANISATIONS NEEDING EXTRA PERSONNEL.

THE CHALLENGE FOR GOVERNMENT AFTER THIS ELECTION, AND ONE TO 
WHICH THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ARE FULLY COMMITTED, IS TO PUT 
IN PLACE A NATIONAL COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMME TO GIVE 
THE UNEMPLOYED THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN IN THE ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL LIFE OF THE COUNTRY, OFFERING THEM THE DIGNITY AND SENSE OF 
BELONGING WHICH EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD ENJOY.

 THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TOO TO FOCUS RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY ON 
URBAN UNEMPLOYMENT BLACKSPOTS. THESE REPRESENT BOTH IN SOCIAL 
AND ECONOMIC TERMS A REAL CHALLENGE TO SOCIETY AT LARGE.

TALK OF TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS WHERE THE SO-CALLED RISING TIDE 
OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL LIFT ALL BOATS IS MEANINGLESS FOR MANY OF 
OUR NEIGHBOURHOODS. WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE EXCHEQUER AND 
EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND RESOURCES ON URBAN DISADVANTAGE. THIS 
SHOULD BE BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF BOTTOM-UP DEVELOPMENT WITH 
STRONG COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT.

THE APPROACH SHOULD BE MULTI-DISCIPLINARY AND SHOULD 
CONCENTRATE ON RESOURCES FROM PRE-SCHOOL LEVEL UPWARDS AND 
EXTEND TO WIDER ISSUES IN EDUCATION AND RESOURCE CENTRES.

WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY 
STATUTORY AND VOLUNTARY AGENCIES IN THE TARGET AREAS. THESE CAN 
DRAW HEAVILY ON THE EXISTING EXPERIENCE OF COMMUNITY 
DEVELOPMENT ON THE EC POVERTY III PROGRAMME AND OTHERS 
WHICH HAVE PIONEERED THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
BASED ON PARTNERSHIP IN RECENT YEARS.

CARING FOR ALL 
THERE ARE NOW 715,000 SOCIAL WELFARE BENEFICIARIES WHO HAVE A 
FURTHER 600,000 DEPENDANTS. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEREFORE ON 
SOCIAL WELFARE EXCEEDS THE WCRKFORCE OF 1.1 MILLION BY OVER 
200,000.

WHILE THE CENTRAL THRUST OF THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS POLICIES 
FOR THE NEXT GOVERNMENT IS TO GENERATE GREATER EMPLOYMENT IT IS 
ALSO ESSENTIAL THAT OUR MAJOR SOCIAL SERVICES ARE
DELIVERED EFFICIENTLY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OUR PEOPLE.

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS THEREFORE PROPOSE:

THE INCOMES OF PEOPLE ON SOCIAL WELFARE MUST BE FULLY PROTECTED.
DEVELOP THE FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT (FIS) INTO A UNIVERSAL 
LOW INCOME EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT SCHEME TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO 
TAKE ALL AVAILABLE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AT PRESENT IT IS 
RESTRICTED TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN.
A GRADUATED MEDICAL CARD ENTITLEMENT SYSTEM TO BE EXAMINED TO 
ENSURE MEDICAL CARD-HOLDERS ARE NOT FINANCIALLY DISADVANTAGED IF 
THEY TAKE UP EMPLOYMENT, RESULTING IN THE SUDDEN LOSS OF A RANGE 
OF WELFARE BENEFITS.

THE COST OF HEALTHCARE HAS BEEN RISING RAPIDLY IN ALL COUNTRIES AND 
POSES MAJOR FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES FOR MANY COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS 
IN IRELAND. SOME EASING OF THE FINANCIAL BURDEN CAN BE ACHIEVED 
THROUGH MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THE AVAILABLE FUNDS AND THAT MUST 
BE A PRIORITY

THERE IS ALSO AN URGENT NEED TO MAKE MORE EFFECTIVE PROGRESS IN 
TRANSFERRING RESOURCES WITHIN THE HEALTH BUDGET INTO PRIMARY 
COMMUNITY CARE SERVICES.

BUT IN THE LONGER TERM A MUCH GREATER CONTRIBUTION MUST COME 
FROM CHANGES IN LIFESTYLES AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS WHICH WILL 
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF ILLNESS AND THE NEED FOR 
TREATMENTS.

 FOR INSTANCE IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE ABOUT 10,000 DEATHS IN 
IRELAND EACH YEAR
RELATED TO SMOKING, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAIN CAUSES OF LUNG 
CANCER AND HEART DISEASE.

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS SPECIFIC PROPOSALS INCLUDE:
A NATIONAL STOP-SMOKING CAMPAIGN AIMED PARTICULARLY AT YOUNGER 
PEOPLE.
COURSES IN HEALTHY LIFESTYLES TO BE PART OF ALL PRIMARY AND 
SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAMMES.
MORE COMPETITION TO BE ALLOWED IN THE PROVISION OF HEALTH 
INSURANCE.
ALL FAMILY PLANNING METHODS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL GMS 
PATIENTS, AND IN ALL PUBLIC HOSPITALS.
A FREE NATIONAL SCREENING SERVICE FOR CERVICAL CANCER.

OUR TEACHERS AND OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM HAVE MADE AN ENORMOUS 
CONTRIBUTION TO THE BETTERMENT OF IRISH SOCIETY, BUT GREATER 
RESOURCES MUST HE SUPPLIED AT PRIMARY LEVEL, PARTICULARLY IN 
DISADVANTAGED AREAS.

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE 
PUPIL/TEACHER RATIO AND PROVIDING MORE REMEDIAL TEACHERS, 
ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED AREAS.


 IN GOVERNMENT, THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN 
ACHIEVING LIMITED REFORM OF HE THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION GRANTS 
SCHEME, TO TACKLE INEQUITIES IN THE SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY AS THEY 
RELATE TO THE PAYE SECTOR.

WE PROPOSE THAT THIS PROCESS OF REFORM BE CONTINUED TO ENSURE A 
FAIR AND TRANSPARENT
GRANTS SYSTEM FOR ALL STUDENTS.

BEATING CRIME AND VANDALISM 

THERE IS NOW AN EPIDEMIC OF CRIME AND VANDALISM IN OUR 
COUNTRY. MANY PEOPLE NO LONGER FEEL SAFE, EITHER IN THEIR HOMES 
OR ON THE STREETS. THIS SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS IS COMPOUNDED BY A 
FEELING THAT THE SCALES OF JUSTICE ARE TIPPED IN FAVOUR OF THE 
CRIMINAL.

THIS PROBLEM HAS SEVERAL ELEMENTS. SOPHISTICATED CRIMINALS ARE 
FINANCING CRIME THROUGH DRUG DEALING AND MONEY LAUNDERING. IN 
ADDITION, THE VAST MAJORITY OF ACCUSED PERSONS OBTAIN BAIL AND, 
FEELING THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE WHILE ON BAIL, USE THAT 
FREEDOM TO COMMIT FURTHER CRIMES.

ANY REFORM OF THE CRIMINAL LAW MUST SEEK TO ADDRESS THESE TWIN 
PROBLEMS. WE PROPOSE:

MEASURES TO ENSURE MORE UNIFORM SENTENCING POLICY IN THE 
COURTS.
THE SWIFT INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR THE 
SEIZURE OF THE ASSETS OF MONEY LAUNDERERS AND DRUG DEALERS. THIS 
IS AN ESTABLISHED FEATURE OF US ANTI RACKETEERING LEGISLATION (THE 
SO-CALLED "RICO LAWS") AND ONE WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY OVERDUE 
IN THIS COUNTRY AS A MEANS OF DEALING WITH ORGANISED CRIME.
A SPECIAL GARDA TASK FORCE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO TARGET THE 
RECEIVERS OF STOLEN GOODS.
 REFORM OF BAIL LAWS TO PREVENT THE PRESENT ABUSE OF OUR 
GENEROUS RIGHTS TO BAIL IN ORDER TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE 
INTERESTS OF THE ACCUSED AND THE VICTIMS OF CRIME
PROPER SYSTEM OF VICTIM COMPENSATION.

ANOTHER MAJOR FEATURE OF THE CRIME PROBLEM IS GANGS OF YOUTH 
ENGAGED IN PETTY CRIME IN
THEIR OWN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM WE 
PROPOSE:

THERE NEEDS TO BE A PROPER SYSTEM OF FAMILY AND JUVENILE COURTS 
NATIONWIDE THAT APPROX. 40% OF CRIME IS CARRIED OUT BY 
JUVENILES.
LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF GANGS ROAMING 
LOCAL STREETS. THE GARDAI WOULD BE EMPOWERED TO STOP LOITERING 
AND BE GIVEN POWERS OF DISPERSAL.
MAKING PARENTS RESPONSIBLE IN CERTAIN CASES FOR THE ACTS OF THEIR 
CHILDREN WHERE THERE HAS BEEN NEGLIGENCE ON THEIR PART. IN OTHER 
WORDS PARENTS MIGHT IN SOME CASES BE REQUIRED TO PAY 
COMPENSATION TO THE VICTIMS OF THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THEIR 
CHILDREN.

AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ARE COMMITTED TO POLICIES WHICH 
SUPPORT AGRICULTURE, ENCOURAGE JOB CREATION IN FOOD PROCESSING 
AND MAINTAIN VIBRANT RURAL COMMUNITIES AS A VITAL ELEMENT OF IRISH 
SOCIETY.

A SUCCESSFUL GATT AGREEMENT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF IRISH 
FARMING AND THE IRISH ECONOMY.
ACTION IS NEEDED TO STOP FARM INCOMES FALLING. WE WILL PRESS FOR 
A REVERSAL OF THE TEMPORARY 4% CUT IN MILK QUOTAS.
WE SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF MCA'S ON EXPORTS TO BRITAIN 
UNTIL THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY'S CURRENCY CRISIS IS RESOLVED.
TO ENCOURAGE THE ENTRY OF YOUNG PEOPLE INTO FARMING, THE BURDEN 
OF CAPITAL ACQUISITION'S TAX (CAT) MUST BE REMOVED FROM LAND 
TRANSFERS TO FAMILY FARMS.
IN FACE OF CAP REFORMS, GREATER EMPHASIS ON DIVERSIFICATION INTO 
HORTICULTURE, ORGANIC FARMING, AGRI-TOURISM AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE 
FARM ENTERPRISES MUST BE ACCELERATED.
IN GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS, THE PROGRESSIVE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE ENSURED THAT EXPORT CREDIT INSURANCE, A VITAL AID 
TO THE IRISH FOOD INDUSTRY, HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED ON A FAIR BASIS 
IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL PROCESSORS AND PRODUCERS.

THE ENVIRONMENT PARTY

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE BUILDING 
ON OUR OUTSTANDING RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT IN PROTECTING AND 
ENHANCING OUR NATURAL AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT. IN GOVERNMENT THE 
PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS WOULD ENSURE THAT:


ALL GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PLANS WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT SO THAT THE IMPLICATIONS FOR 
THE ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE FULLY ASSESSED.
ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION HELD BY STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE 
THERE ARE SECURITY OR TRADE RELATED RISKS.
THE COAL BAN WHICH WORKS SO SUCCESSFULLY IN DUBLIN WILL BE 
EXTENDED TO ALL MAJOR URBAN AREAS OVER FIVE YEARS.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WILL BE FULLY RESOURCED 
AND STAFFED DURING 1993.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTIONS OF THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC WORKS WILL 
BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OFFICE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND THE ROADS RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT.
ALL STATE BODIES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GARDAI AND DEFENCE 
FORCES) WOULD COME UNDER THE SCOPE OF THE PLANNING ACTS. LOCAL 
AUTHORITY DEVELOPMENTS WOULD BE REFERRED TO BORD PLEANALA FOR 
APPROVAL.
STATE FUNDING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANISATIONS I.E. AN TAISCE, 
ECO AND EARTHWATCH.
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CLEANER IRELAND TASK FORCE WHICH WOULD 
ORGANISE AND IMPLEMENT A NATIONAL CRACKDOWN ON LITTER. 
COMPREHENSIVE NEW WASTE LEGISLATION WOULD BE INTRODUCED 
WHICH WILL PLACE THE EMPHASIS ON WASTE PREVENTION AND 
MINIMISATION.  A NEW NATIONAL WASTE STRATEGY WILL SET RECYCLING 
AND RE-USE TARGETS BOTH ON A NATIONAL AND REGIONAL BASIS. INDUSTRY 
WILL BE GIVEN FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO MINIMISE WASTE.
THE HANDLING OF WASTE WILL BE RATIONALISED AND REORGANISED ON A 
REGIONAL BASIS WHICH WILL RESULT IN FEWER LANDFILL SITES, OPERATED 
TO HIGHER STANDARDS.
ALL WASTE HANDLERS AND FACILITIES WILL BE LICENSED AND MONITORED 
BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AGENCY.

CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE

IT IS NOW JUST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS SINCE THE ALL-PARTY COMMITTEE ON 
THE CONSTITUTION REPORTED IN 1967. MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE THAT 
DATE AND YET THERE HAS BEEN NO SYSTEMATIC EXAMINATION BY THE 
DAIL OF THE WORKINGS OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE PROGRESSIVE 
DEMOCRATS PERFORMED THAT TASK IN JANUARY 1988 WITH OUR 
"CONSTITUTION FOR A NEW REPUBLIC", BUT IT IS A TASK WHICH 
URGENTLY NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED BY THE IN-COMING DAIL, ON AN 
AGREED ALL-PARTY BASIS.

AMONG THE MATTERS IN OUR PRESENT CONSTITUTION REQUIRING RE-
CONSIDERATION ARE:

ARTICLES 2 & 3. 
THE ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 41 ON THE ENACTMENT 
OF DIVORCE LEGISLATION.
THE ROLE OF THE SEANAD.
CABINET CONFIDENTIALITY: IS THE NEW ABSOLUTE BAN ON THE 
DISCLOSURE OF ANY CABINET DISCUSSIONS COMPATIBLE WITH OPEN 
GOVERNMENT?
THE ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT: SHOULD SHE BE GIVEN WIDER POWERS 
SUCH AS A ROLE IN APPOINTING THE MEMBERS OF AN INDEPENDENT 
BOUNDARY COMMISSION?
THE LAW OF BAIL: IS IT ACCEPTABLE AS OUR SOCIETY ENDURES AN 
UPSURGE OF VIOLENT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT ACCUSED PERSONS CANNOT 
BE DENIED BAIL EVEN WHERE THERE IS LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL 
COMMIT CRIMES WHILE ON BAIL? IN CUR VIEW THE PREVALENCE OF 
SERIOUS CRIMES COMMITTED BY PERSONS RELEASED ON BAIL MEANS THAT 
THE PRESENT LAW IS SOMETHING OF A LUXURY IN OUR PRESENT CRIME-
RIDDEN SOCIETY.

LAW REFORM 

AT PRESENT, THE COURTS ARE CREAKING UNDER THE BURDEN OF LITIGATION 
AND THERE IS A PRESSING NEED FOR URGENT LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN A HOST 
OF AREAS. THESE INCLUDE:

JOINT OWNERSHIP OF THE FAMILY HOME. IN THE LIGHT OF A SUPREME 
COURT DECISION LAST DECEMBER (WHICH CONFIRMED THAT WIVES WHO 
HAVE MADE NO FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FAMILY INCOME HAVE 
NO OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE FAMILY HOME), LEGISLATIVE CHANGE 
ALONG THESE LINES IS URGENTLY NECESSARY.
THE LAW OF OCCUPIERS' LIABILITY. THE OPERATION OF THIS LAW IS 
CAUSING GREAT CONCERN TO FARMERS, VOLUNTARY GROUPS, SCHOOLS AND 
OTHERS. IN PRACTICE THE SITUATION NOW APPEARS TO BE THAT OWNERS 
AND OCCUPIERS OF LAND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ACCIDENTS SUFFERED 
BY OTHERS WHILE ON THEIR LAND AND THIS MUST BE CHANGED. 

THE HIGH COST OF PERSONAL INJURY AWARDS. THE COST OF SUCH 
AWARDS RENDERS CAR INSURANCE PREMIA FOR YOUNG DRIVERS 
PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AND FORCES MANY OF THEM OFF THE ROADS. 
WE NEED NEW FORMS OF ARBITRATION TO ENSURE THAT THESE CASES ARE 
HEARD SPEEDILY AND WITH LESS COST.
REFORM OF THE LIBEL LAWS. AS THE LAW REFORM COMMISSION 
REPORT DEMONSTRATED WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM DAMAGES AS AN 
EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF COMPENSATING THE
 LIBEL VICTIM AND EXPLORE OTHER POSSIBILITIES OF SETTING THE MATTER 
STRAIGHT. AS THE LAW REFORM COMMISSION POINTED OUT, THE 
PRESENT LAW OF LIBEL SERIOUSLY INHIBITS THE PRESS AND A NEW 
BALANCE MUST BE STRUCK WHICH WOULD GIVE GREATER WEIGHT TO THE 
PUBLIC INTEREST IN AN UNINHIBITED AND FREE PRESS.
ABOLITION OF GROUND RENTS. WE HAVE ALREADY PUBLISHED DETAILED 
PROPOSALS FOR THE PHASED ABOLITION OF ALL REMAINING GROUND RENTS 
OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD, AND A BILL TO DO THIS WAS PART OF THE 
REVISED PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT.

CONVERTING THE LAND REGISTRY AND REGISTRY OF DEEDS INTO 
COMMERCIAL SEMI-STATE BODIES. IF THIS WAS DONE, IT WOULD EXTEND 
THE SYSTEM OF LARD REGISTRATION WHICH IS ALSO VITAL IF CONVEYANCING 
COSTS ARE TO BE BROUGHT DOWN.

IRISH LANGUAGE AND CULTURE 

THE IRISH LANGUAGE IS A UNIQUE AND DISTINCT FEATURE OF OUR CULTURAL 
HERITAGE. THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ARE COMMITTED TO THE 
PRESERVATION, DEVELOPMENT AND EXTENSION OF THE LANGUAGE AND SEE 
THE IMMEDIATE ESTABLISHMENT OF TELEFFS NA GEALTACHTA AS ESSENTIAL 
TO PROTECTING AND DEVELOPING THE LANGUAGE.

TEACHERS OF IRISH MUST HAVE ACCESS TO IN-SERVICE TRAINING AND 
REFRESHER COURSES. THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS STRONGLY SUPPORT 
THE ESTABLISHMENT ALL-IRISH SCHOOLS WHERE THE DEMAND FOR SUCH 
FACILITIES EXISTS.

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT SCOPE FOR 
JOB CREATION IN THE AREAS OF ARTS, CRAFTS, CULTURE AND HERITAGE. WE 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED FOR PROPER PUBLIC FUNDING AND A COHERENT 
DEVELOPMENT PLAN IN THESE AREAS.

WORKING FOR PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO WORKING FAR 
PEACE AND RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE DIVIDED COMMUNITIES OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND, AND GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND A
BETTER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE REPUBLIC.

THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS ARE COMMITTED TO THE CURRENT ROUND 
OF NORTHERN TALKS, AND HAVE PARTICIPATED FULLY AT GOVERNMENT 
LEVEL IN HELPING TO ACHIEVE A LEVEL OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND 
TRUST THAT WILL ENABLE A NEW POLITICAL SETTLEMENT TO BE AGREED 
WHICH IN TURN WOULD BEGIN TO OVERCOME THE APPALLING CYCLE OF 
MURDER AND VIOLENCE THERE.

SHOULD THE CURRENT TALKS, PRESIDED OVER BY SIR NINIAN STEPHEN, 
REACH THE STAGE WHERE COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT EMBRACING THE 
THREE STRANDS OF RELATIONSHIPS - BETWEEN THE TWO COMMUNITIES 
WITHIN NORTHERN IRELAND; BETWEEN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE 
REPUBLIC, AND BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC AND BRITAIN - IS FULLY AGREED,  
AND WHICH WOULD TRANSCEND THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT SIGNED AT 
HILLSBOROUGH IN 1985. THEN THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS IN 
GOVERNMENT WOULD SUPPORT PLACING SUCH AN AGREEMENT BEFORE 
THE IRISH PEOPLE FOR RATIFICATION, ALONG WITH ANY CONSEQUENTIAL 
MODIFICATIONS OF ARTICLES 2 & 3 TO EXPRESS THEM AS AN ASPIRATION 
OF THE MAJORITY OF IRISH PEOPLE TO UNITY.

PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT

IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS REMAIN 
COMMITTED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICIES WE INCLUDED IN 
THE REVISED PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT OF OCTOBER 1991.
