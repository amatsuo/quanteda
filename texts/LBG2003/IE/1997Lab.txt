IRE LABOUR MANIFESTO 1997

VISION AND CHALLENGES





1	IRELAND APPROACHES THE 21ST CENTURY IN A SPIRIT OF HIGH EXPECTATION. 
VALUES AND VISION ARE CRUCIAL. NEVER BEFORE HAVE THERE BEEN SO MANY GROUNDS FOR 
OPTIMISM. NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE HAD SO MUCH TO BUILD ON.

2	BUILDING HOPE AND CONFIDENCE FOR THE FUTURE WE FACE REQUIRES A MIX - A MIX 
OF VALUES, OF VISION, AND OF PRACTICAL POLICIES.  THIS DOCUMENT SEEKS TO EXPRESS 
THAT BALANCE.

3	OUR KEY PRIORITIES FOR THE START OF THE 21ST CENTURY ARE THESE:

PERMANENT PEACE THROUGHOUT IRELAND BASED ON A JUST POLITICAL SETTLEMENT, 
INCLUSIVELY NEGOTIATED AND ROOTED IN CONSENT;

AN INTENSIFICATION OF THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY AND LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT;

THE EFFECTIVE TACKLING OF  PRESENT DAY CRIME - RECOGNISING THAT ITS ROOT CAUSES 
OF  SOCIAL ALIENATION AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION MUST BE FACED WITH THE SAME SINGLE-
MINDEDNESS.

4	SIDE BY SIDE WITH THESE OVER-RIDING OBJECTIVES, BUILDING HOPE AND 
CONFIDENCE DEPENDS TOO ON THE RIGHT APPROACH TO: 

 
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, 
PUBLIC SPENDING AND TAXATION, 
IRELAND'S ROLE IN EUROPE AND THE WORLD,
EDUCATION POLICY, 
PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM, 
ENHANCING OUR ENVIRONMENT, 
OUR HERITAGE AND OUR ARTISTIC DEVELOPMENT AS A PEOPLE.

THESE,  AND MANY OTHER TOPICS, ARE DEALT WITH IN THIS DOCUMENT.

5	WE ALSO HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS AND FURTHER REFORMS ARISING FROM THE 
GOVERNMENT "PROGRAMME FOR RENEWAL" TO CARRY THROUGH TO COMPLETION. 

6	LABOUR HAS BEEN AT THE HEART OF THE CHANGES WHICH ARE MAKING THIS A 
BETTER, MORE TOLERANT AND MORE PROSPEROUS IRELAND.

7	FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS, LABOUR HAS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF GROWTH, 
DEVELOPMENT, AND CHANGE IN IRISH SOCIETY AND IN IRISH POLITICS. 

8	A GREAT DEAL OF THAT CHANGE HAS BEEN FUNDAMENTAL, AND IT HAS LED TO HIGHER 
STANDARDS OF LIVING AND A MUCH BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR THE HARD PRESSED PAYE 
TAXPAYER. FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES. FOR THOSE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. 


9	FOR WOMEN IN EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING IN THE HOME. FOR FAMILIES WITH 
CHILDREN IN OR ENTERING THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION. FOR THOSE STARTING AND DEVELOPING 
SMALL BUSINESSES. FOR PEOPLE LOCKED INTO BROKEN MARRIAGES. FOR THE RETURNED 
EMIGRANTS WHO HAVE FOUND JOBS AT HOME. FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON LONG HOSPITAL 
WAITING LISTS. FOR PEOPLE COPING WITH, AND SEEKING TO OVERCOME, HANDICAP OR 
DISABILITY.

10	NEVER HAVE SO MANY REAL JOBS BEEN CREATED IN THE ECONOMY IN SUCH A SHORT 
PERIOD. NEVER HAS SO MUCH SOCIAL LEGISLATION AND SOCIAL REFORM BEEN ACHIEVED. 
NEVER HAS THE SELF-CONFIDENCE AND ENERGY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE BEEN MORE IN 
EVIDENCE. 

11	NEVER HAS IRELAND'S POSITION AND ROLE IN EUROPE AND THE WORLD BEEN MORE 
STRONGLY ARTICULATED AND ASSERTED. 

12	BUT  MAJOR CHALLENGES STILL REMAIN TO BE FACED - IN OUR SOCIETY, IN OUR 
CITIES, IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, TOWNS AND VILLAGES.

13	THEN, THERE HAVE BEEN SETBACKS. THE PARAMILITARY CEASE-FIRES OF AUTUMN 
1994 WERE OPENLY BROKEN BY THE IRA AT CANARY WHARF IN FEBRUARY 1996. SEVENTEEN 
MONTHS OF HOPE AND JOY AT THE STOPPING OF KILLINGS WERE SHATTERED, AT LEAST 
TEMPORARILY. 

14	LABOUR, WITH ALL PARTIES IN THE D·IL AND MANY OF THE PARTIES IN THE NORTH 
WHO WORKED IN THE FORUM FOR PEACE AND RECONCILIATION, HAD TO PICK UP THE PIECES, 
AND CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE AGAINST A MORE DIFFICULT AND TENSE 
BACKGROUND. 

15	NORTHERN IRELAND, AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PEACE, REMAINS OUR GREATEST 
PRIORITY.   LABOUR HAS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN THE 
PROGRESS TOWARDS AN INCLUSIVE SETTLEMENT BASED ON CONSENT. 
16	WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE DOWNING STREET DECLARATION 
AND THE JOINT FRAMEWORK DOCUMENTS, AND WE ARE TOTALLY COMMITTED TO THE 
PRINCIPLES THEY CONTAIN. LABOUR HAS ALSO PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT PART IN THE 
NEGOTIATIONS THAT LED TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF ALL-PARTY TALKS IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND, AND IN THE GROUND RULES THAT UNDERPIN THEM. WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO 
GIVING THOSE TALKS RENEWED URGENCY AND MOMENTUM. 

17	INCLUSION AND CONSENT WILL REMAIN THE HALLMARKS OF OUR POLICY. WE HAVE 
STRESSED, AGAIN AND AGAIN, THE RIGHT OF EVERY SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND TO BE REPRESENTED AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  WE HAVE ASSERTED, 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO, THAT THE ONLY BARRIER TO THAT, IN OUR VIEW, IS ADHERENCE 
TO AN ARMED AND VIOLENT APPROACH.  

18	WE CALL IN THIS DOCUMENT FOR THE URGENT RESTORATION OF PEACE, ON AN 
UNEQUIVOCAL BASIS, AND FOR A TOTAL COMMITMENT TO THE MITCHELL PRINCIPLES.

19	THERE ARE SOME 200,000 MORE PEOPLE AT WORK IN IRELAND NOW COMPARED WITH 
FOUR YEARS AGO. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LACK OF A JOB AND THE RISK AND FEAR OF 
NEVER FINDING A JOB IS A GRIM REALITY FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF ADULT MEN AND WOMEN 
AND YOUNG PEOPLE.

20	MUCH HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED - AND A LOT ACHIEVED -  IN TERMS OF MITIGATING THE 
CRISIS OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT;  COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT, IMPROVED TRAINING 
SCHEMES, MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADULT EDUCATION, PLACEMENT AND COUNSELLING 
SERVICES AND SOCIAL WELFARE IMPROVEMENTS. 

21	LOCAL COMMUNITIES, STATE AGENCIES, AND THE SOCIAL PARTNERS, ARE WORKING 
MORE EFFECTIVELY TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP THAN EVER BEFORE.




22	 NEVERTHELESS, IT IS AS UNTRUE TODAY AS IT ALWAYS WAS THAT THE "RISING 
TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS". IT IS EVIDENT THAT SOCIETY AS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED FAILS 
TO ENSURE THAT OPPORTUNITIES APPLY EQUALLY TO ALL INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS, 
INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED.

23	THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT VIOLENT CRIMINAL ACTS, OFTEN DIRECTED AGAINST WOMEN 
AND THE ELDERLY, AND MAJOR SOCIAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG ABUSE ARE 
FEATURES OF TODAY'S IRELAND.  IN THIS RESPECT, WE, AS A SOCIETY FACE AN IMMENSE 
CHALLENGE. 

24	IN THIS MANIFESTO, LABOUR OFFERS WIDE- RANGING MEASURES TO GRAPPLE WITH 
THE REALITY OF VIOLENT CRIME AND DRUG TRAFFICKING WITH ITS ASSOCIATED TRAIL OF 
CRIMINALITY. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS A CLEAR NEED TO INTENSIFY PROGRAMMES TO 
CONTAIN AND REHABILITATE THOSE TRAPPED IN DRUG DEPENDENCY. OUR APPROACH IS BASED 
ON THE KNOWLEDGE THAT NO SIMPLE SLOGANS OR  INSTANT SOLUTIONS WILL END THIS 
SCOURGE.

25	WE WILL BE TOUGH AND SINGLE-MINDED IN SUPPORTING THE REFORMS IN THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH SERIOUS CRIME. AT THE SAME TIME, 
OUR AIM IS TO REDUCE AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE SOCIAL DEPRIVATION AND INJUSTICE. 
TOO OFTEN, THESE ARE PRIMARY FACTORS IN CAUSING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR TO BEGIN AND 
TO GROW.

26	OUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE EMBRACES BOTH A SET OF VALUES AND A RANGE OF 
POLICY MEASURES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THESE VALUES. KEY ELEMENTS OF THAT 
VISION AND THOSE VALUES ARE:

FREEDOM WITH SECURITY
GREATER EQUALITY
SOCIAL COHESIVENESS AND SOLIDARITY
A WIDER SHARING OF PROSPERITY AND PROPERTY.



27	AS WE APPROACH THE MILLENIUM AND THE START OF THE NEW CENTURY, WE ALSO 
BELIEVE THAT VISION SHOULD BE SET IN A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME.  FORWARD PLANNING 
AND STRATEGIC THINKING ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IN OUR APPROACH TO POLITICS.  

28	BY THE YEAR 2010, WHICH IS NOW LESS THAN 15 YEARS AWAY, IRELAND SHOULD 
ACHIEVE THE FOLLOWING:

FULL EMPLOYMENT FOR THOSE SEEKING WORK;
THE BEST MANAGED AND BEST PRESERVED ENVIRONMENT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE MOST EFFECTIVE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
PERCEPTION OUTSIDE EUROPE AS THE BEST PLACE IN WHICH TO INVEST AND DO BUSINESS 
WITHIN THE EU
THE AVERAGE PER CAPITA INCOME OF THE EU MEMBER STATES.

29	THE IRISH CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES A RANGE OF PERSONAL FREEDOMS. OUR 
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY PROVIDES MANY BENEFITS AND PREVENTS MANY ABUSES. DESPITE 
THAT, HOWEVER, IN THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AREA THOSE PERSONAL FREEDOMS HAVE NOT 
BEEN SUBSTANTIATED OR MADE REAL FOR ALL CITIZENS. 

30	IT HAS BEEN RIGHTLY SAID THAT "INCOME EARNING PROPERTY IS A BULWARK OF 
LIBERTY ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE IT". MANY IN OUR COUNTRY HAVE LITTLE OR NO 
PROPERTY AND NO SENSE OF BELONGING TO A LOCAL OR NATIONAL COMMUNITY. MANY CANNOT 
ASSERT THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS THROUGH SHORTAGE OF MONEY. OTHERS FIND IT DIFFICULT OR 
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS EITHER THE JOB MARKET OR SUITABLE TRAINING OR EDUCATIONAL 
PROGRAMMES.  THE FREEDOM OF OTHERS, AND PARTICULARLY WOMEN, CAN BE RESTRICTED 
THROUGH FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN ASSAILANT, FEAR OF THE DRUG PEDDLER, FEAR FOR THEIR 
CHILDREN'S SAFETY IN THE STREETS, AND FOR SOME, FEAR OF VIOLENCE IN THE HOME.
31	FOR US, THE WIDENING OF PERSONAL FREEDOM LINKED WITH SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
IS A KEY CORE VALUE. THIS CAN BE ADVANCED THROUGH:

CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS, 
CHANGES IN LAWS, 
SHARING MORE WIDELY OUR GROWING PROSPERITY, 
COMBINED ACTION AT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND COMMUNITY LEVEL,
EDUCATION TARGETED AT BREAKING THE CYCLE OF DISADVANTAGE, AND THROUGH 
POLITICAL CHOICES -  SUCH AS THE CHOICE NOW BEING OFFERED TO THE PEOPLE AT THIS 
ELECTION.

32	WHILE WE BELIEVE IN, AND ADVOCATE, THE SUBSTANTIATION OF PERSONAL 
FREEDOMS, LABOUR IS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALISM AS A SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY.  
THATCHERITES AND THEIR IRISH CLONES FOLLOW AN ALIEN CREED. 

33	A FAIR SOCIETY DEMANDS DUTIES WHETHER LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE OR NOT, WHILE AT 
THE SAME TIME UPHOLDING RIGHTS.  SUPPORT FOR THE FAMILY, FOR CARERS, FOR THE 
ELDERLY, IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY.

34	THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT MAKING INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY FREEDOMS A REALITY 
IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUE OF EQUALITY. TOO OFTEN, THEY ARE THE 
PRESERVE OF A MINORITY. THAT'S WHY ALL OUR POLICIES ARE GEARED AROUND THE 
CONCEPT OF  GREATER EQUALITY. 

35	OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL IS FREE TO ATTAIN HIS OR HER 
CAPACITY. OUR COMMITMENT IS TO EMANCIPATION, SO THAT MEN AND WOMEN CAN 
CONTRIBUTE BOTH TO THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT AND TO THE BROADER PURPOSES OF SOCIAL 
LIVING IN THE LOCAL, NATIONAL AND WORLD COMMUNITY.

36	THE IDEAS OF SOCIAL COHESIVENESS AND SOLIDARITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL FOR 
LABOUR. IN THAT CONTEXT, WE RECOGNISE THAT PRACTICAL OBJECTIVES HAVE TO BE 
ACHIEVED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARKET ECONOMY. THE GOAL OF  INCREASED 
EMPLOYMENT, AND AN ATTACK ON POVERTY AND ITS CAUSES, MUST BE ACHIEVED AGAINST A 
BACKGROUND OF FREE TRADE, OF RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND COMMUNICATION 
ADVANCES. 

37	THE GLOBAL DIMENSION IS INTRUDING EVER MORE STRONGLY INTO NATIONAL AND 
LOCAL ECONOMIES. THE "INFORMATION SOCIETY" IS UPON US.  THESE ARE THE REALITIES. 
THEY ARE CHALLENGES TO BE MET WITH ENTHUSIASM - THE TASK IS TO CHANNEL THE 
BENEFITS OF GROWTH AND CHANGE SO THAT THEY BENEFIT OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND NOT 
JUST SOME.

38	IN  ACCEPTING THE MARKET SYSTEM, WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND PRIVATE 
PROPERTY WE RECOGNISE THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO SEEK TO HUMANISE IT WHERE NECESSARY, 
BUT WITHOUT UNDERMINING ITS CAPACITY TO PERFORM.

39	THIS CAN BE DONE MAINLY BY:

APPROPRIATE REGULATION 
SPREADING THE OWNERSHIP OF PRODUCTIVE PROPERTY 
FOSTERING COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP IN THE MARKET SECTOR, WITH EFFICIENT AND 
ACCOUNTABLE STRUCTURES 
ENLARGING THE LEGAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF BUSINESS ITSELF
PRESERVING CHOSEN AREAS FROM MARKET FORCES.

40	ESPECIALLY WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED ARE CONCERNED, THE 
MARKET SYSTEM NEEDS MODIFICATION.  THE HUMAN DIMENSION OF THIS IS CRITICAL - THE 
MARKET SYSTEM IS AN INSTRUMENT CAPABLE OF PROVIDING EFFICIENCY, NOT AN ETHICAL 
IMPERATIVE. IN THE REAL WORLD, PEOPLE START OUT WITH WIDELY DIVERGENT DEGREES OF 
POWER AND WEALTH. EQUITY AND SOCIAL SOLIDARITY ARE THE REAL IMPERATIVES.
41	WE WELCOME THIS ELECTION. WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT IDEAS FORWARD, 
AND TO SEEK A MANDATE FOR THEM.  THE POLICIES IN THIS MANIFESTO ARE OURS - THEY 
ARE THE BASIS ON WHICH WE WANT TO GO FORWARD. 

42	WE WILL, OF COURSE, BE CAMPAIGNING IN THIS ELECTION AS PART OF AN OUT-
GOING GOVERNMENT.  IT IS A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS ACHIEVED MUCH.  IT IS BUILT ON 
TRUST AMONG PARTNERS, AND ON MUTUAL RESPECT.  WHEN THE ELECTION IS OVER, IT IS 
OUR HOPE THAT WE WILL HAVE A MANDATE TO SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE AN AGREED 
PROGRAMME FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THOSE NEGOTIATIONS 
WILL TAKE PLACE HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED SEPARATELY BY THE GOVERNMENT PARTIES AS A 
WHOLE.

43	IN THAT SENSE, THIS MANIFESTO IS THE SET OF PROPOSALS THAT WE WILL BRING 
TO THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. WE WANT TO NEGOTIATE FROM STRENGTH. WE INTEND TO FIGHT 
THE STRONGEST ELECTION POSSIBLE, AND TO DO SO ON THE BASIS OF POLICIES NOT 
PERSONALITIES.  THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THE VOICE OF THE VOICELESS HEARD AS 
LOUD AS POSSIBLE.  



44	WE WILL PRESENT OUR ACHIEVEMENTS, OUR VALUES AND OUR POLICIES ON AS MANY 
DOOR-STEPS AS POSSIBLE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.  WE WANT TO LISTEN.  WE FACE A 
PERIOD OF EXCITING CHANGE, AND MANY CHALLENGES. WE ARE SETTING OUT OUR STALL - 
THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO CONSTRUCT AN EVER MORE CONFIDENT, JUST, INCLUSIVE AND 
TOLERANT IRELAND.

45	AND WE DO IT WITH CONFIDENCE. THE TRACK RECORD OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE 
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. VISIONS AND CHALLENGES, COMBINED WITH PRACTICAL POLICIES. A 
SLATE OF CANDIDATES THAT IS SECOND TO NONE. DEEP ROOTS IN THE COMMUNITY, AND A 
TOTAL COMMITMENT TO ITS FUTURE. THAT'S LABOUR'S PROMISE.




MANAGING A 
GROWING 
ECONOMY




BUILDING ON SUCCESS

1	IRELAND HAS MADE ENORMOUS ECONOMIC ADVANCES OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. 
AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF SUCCESS, OUR  ECONOMIC OBJECTIVE IS SIMPLE: THE CREATION 
OF SUSTAINABLE WEALTH, AND ITS FAIR DISTRIBUTION.

2	LABOUR'S MAIN PRIORITY IS TO BUILD FURTHER ON THE RECORD NUMBER OF NEW 
JOBS CREATED IN RECENT YEARS. WE WILL INTENSIFY WITH SPECIFIC POLICIES THE FIGHT 
AGAINST PERSISTENT AND LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT IN CO-OPERATION WITH LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES AND THE SOCIAL PARTNERS.

3	OUR OBJECT IS TO ENSURE THAT THE FACTORS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR 
ECONOMIC SUCCESS CONTINUE. THESE HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE:
* PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE PUBLIC FINANCES  
* A PARTNERSHIP APPROACH TO EVOLVING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICY  
* THE PRIORITISATION OF ENTERPRISE AND INNOVATION AS KEY ELEMENTS IN THE 
CREATION OF ECONOMIC WEALTH


* A CONTINUAL PRIORITY FOR INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT, AND
* CONSTRUCTIVE PARTICIPATION IN SHAPING OUR FUTURE AS PART OF THE EUROPEAN 
UNION.
FUTURE CHALLENGES

4	THE MAASTRICHT CRITERIA RELATING TO ISSUES SUCH AS DEBT LEVELS AND 
BORROWING, TO INFLATION TARGETS, TO MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE RATE HAVE BEEN 
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS ON POLICY.  IN IRELAND'S CASE IN RECENT YEARS, OBSERVING 
THEM HAS BEEN BENEFICIAL TO OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. 

5	FOR THE FUTURE, TWO MAIN CHALLENGES ARE:
_ OUR PREPARATION FOR THE INCEPTION OF ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION, AND 
_ THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WILL ARISE IN THE RENEGOTIATION OF STRUCTURAL FUNDS FOR 
EARLY IN THE NEXT CENTURY DUE TO OUR GREATLY INCREASED LEVELS OF WEALTH AS A 
NATION.

6	THIS WILL REQUIRE A SHARED DISCIPLINE IN IRELAND IN THE FUTURE. WEALTH 
CREATION AND DISTRIBUTION WILL HAVE TO BE SUSTAINABLE. 
7	IN THE CONTEXT OF EMU, THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT IN COURSE OF 
FINALISATION AT EU LEVEL WILL BE A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE TO FISCAL MANAGEMENT.

LABOUR'S APPROACH

8	WE BELIEVE THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH MUST BE FAIRLY SHARED. THEY 
PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TACKLE DEEP-SEATED PROBLEMS, POVERTY, AND SOCIAL 
DEPRIVATION. WE CAN RAISE STANDARDS OF SERVICE, CARE AND DIGNITY FOR THOSE 
WITHOUT A VOICE - PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, CHILDREN AT RISK, THE HOMELESS, 
PEOPLE WHO ARE FRAIL OR ELDERLY, AND THEIR CARERS.

9	A STRONG AND THRIVING ECONOMY CAN AND MUST SUPPORT QUALITY HEALTH AND 
EDUCATION SERVICES. BOTH OF THESE ARE A CRUCIAL PART OF EVERYONE'S STANDARD OF 
LIVING.

10	PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IN IRELAND IS RELATIVELY LOW BY EU STANDARDS. STANDARDS 
OF PUBLIC SERVICES STILL LAG BEHIND THOSE OF MANY OF OUR EU PARTNERS. WE 
THEREFORE PROPOSE TO STRIKE A FAIR BALANCE BETWEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC 
SERVICES, AN ASSAULT ON DEPRIVATION, AND INCREASES IN PERSONAL DISPOSABLE 
INCOMES THROUGH PLANNED REDUCTIONS IN THE TAX TAKE.

11	WE REJECT THE IDEOLOGY WHICH WOULD CUT PUBLIC SERVICES AND CURTAIL ANY 
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO CHANNEL ALL THE BENEFITS OF GROWTH INTO TAX 
REDUCTIONS SKEWED TO THE HIGHER PAID. 

12	IN SHORT, OUR APPROACH IS TO SEEK A FAIR BALANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC SPENDING 
AND THE TAX TAKE, AND TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE OUR NATIONAL DEBT AS A PROPORTION OF 
GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT.  

13	THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE £16 BILLION SPENT EACH YEAR IS ALL WELL 
TARGETED, THAT THERE IS NO INEFFICIENCY OR WASTE AT ALL, THAT THERE IS NOT SOME 
MISDIRECTION IN PUBLIC SPENDING PROGRAMMES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK A BETTER 
FOCUS AND DIRECTION FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMES. WE WILL ACTIVELY 
ENCOURAGE THE EMERGING PROCESS OF PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM.

14	THE CONTINUATION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AT A HIGH LEVEL OF ABOUT 5% ON AVERAGE 
(IT IS HIGHER THAN THIS AT PRESENT) PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ARRIVING AT AN 
APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN EXPENDITURE ON SERVICES, INVESTMENT IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE, THE TAX-TAKE, AND KEEPING BORROWING UNDER CONTROL.

15	THEREFORE, LABOUR WILL PLAN FOR:
* GROWTH IN REAL CURRENT EXPENDITURE ON AVERAGE BELOW THE GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY 
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.
* CONTINUING TO REDUCE PERSONAL TAXES, AS A PROPORTION OF GNP.
* ENSURING AS AT PRESENT CONTINUOUS CURRENT BUDGET SURPLUSES.
* USING THE CURRENT BUDGET SURPLUSES FOR ESSENTIAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT  -  IN 
INFRASTRUCTURE, IN SUPPORTS FOR THE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC SECTORS, AND IN NECESSARY 
SOCIAL INVESTMENT  -  THEREBY HELPING TO LIMIT BORROWING FOR NECESSARY CAPITAL 
INVESTMENT TO LEVELS SUSTAINABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF EMU. 	
* A MAXIMUM GENERAL GOVERNMENT DEFICIT EACH YEAR, OF NO MORE THAN 1.5% (SAVE IN 
THE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES ENVISAGED BY THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT), AND 
WILL ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP GOVERNMENT FINANCES AS CLOSE TO BALANCE AS POSSIBLE.

16	IT FOLLOWS THAT THE EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT SPENDING COMMITMENTS IN THIS 
MANIFESTO WILL BE PRIORITISED AND PHASED IN BY REFERENCE TO THESE TARGETS.



PARTNERSHIP AT THE LEVEL OF THE FIRM

17	OUR SUCCESS IN MANAGING CHANGE WILL BE THE KEY TO IRELAND'S FUTURE 
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, AS THE ONLY CERTAINTY IS THE CERTAINTY OF ECONOMIC CHANGE - 
NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, NEW PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES, CHANGES IN MARKETS AND 
PRICING.

18	SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE WILL NOT HAPPEN THROUGH CONFRONTATION AND 
DIKTAT, BUT WHERE MANAGEMENT ENGAGES THE WORKFORCE AS EQUAL PARTNERS. SUCH 
PARTNERSHIP IS A CORE PART OF NEW BUSINESS METHODS LIKE WORLD CLASS 
MANUFACTURING AND TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT, AND IS THE HALLMARK OF PROGRESSIVE 
COMPANIES.

19	TODAY'S WORKFORCE RIGHTLY DEMAND A SAY IN DECISIONS WHICH AFFECT THEIR 
LIVELIHOOD.  LABOUR WILL IMPLEMENT IN FULL THE COMMITMENTS IN PARTNERSHIP 2000 
ON PARTNERSHIP AT THE LEVEL OF THE FIRM.  

20	WE WILL SEEK TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM WHERE COMPANIES PREPARE A PARTNERSHIP 
PROGRAMME IN CONSULTATION WITH THEIR WORKFORCE, TAILORED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
AND SCALE OF THE PARTICULAR BUSINESS, ANALOGOUS TO THE SAFETY STATEMENT REQUIRED 
UNDER LAW.  

21	STATE AIDS TO ENTERPRISE, WHETHER GIVEN THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM OR 
DIRECTLY, WILL BE ACTIVELY USED TO PROMOTE THE AGENDA FOR PARTNERSHIP AT THE 
LEVEL OF THE FIRM.

22	WE WILL EXAMINE MECHANISMS TO ENSURE RECOGNITION OF TRADE UNIONS WHERE THE 
LABOUR COURT HAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE UNION REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION 
OF THE WORKFORCE IN QUESTION.



MINIMUM WAGE

23	ENSURING FAIR WAGES, AND THE ELIMINATION OF EXPLOITATION, ARE CRUCIAL 
ISSUES IN AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. THEY ARE ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE 
SPIRIT OF PARTNERSHIP 2000.

24	ABOUT ONE IN FIVE WORKERS IS CURRENTLY COVERED BY MINIMUM WAGE LEGISLATION 
UNDER THE JOINT LABOUR COMMITTEES AND REGISTERED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS.  THESE 
MINIMUM PAY RATES ARE LEGALLY BINDING AND ARE ENFORCED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF 
ENTERPRISE AND EMPLOYMENT WHO EVERY YEAR RECOVER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POUNDS 
ON BEHALF OF UNDERPAID WORKERS.

25	FREELY NEGOTIATED PAY RATES BETWEEN TRADE UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS WILL 
NORMALLY BE WELL ABOVE THE RATES SET UNDER MINIMUM WAGE RULES. THERE ARE HOWEVER 
SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY WHERE WORKERS ARE LIABLE TO VERY LOW PAY, IN PARTICULAR 
THOSE WORKING FOR SMALLER EMPLOYERS AND IN NON-UNION EMPLOYMENTS.

26	THE PROBLEM OF LOW PAY EXTENDS WELL BEYOND THE SECTORS CURRENTLY COVERED 
BY MINIMUM WAGE RULES. THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT MARKET WAGE RATES ARE 
FAILING TO RESPOND TO SHORTAGES OF LABOUR IN CERTAIN SECTORS WHERE EXTREMELY LOW 
PAY RATES ARE STILL BEING OFFERED.

27	IN THE SHORT TERM, WE WILL EXTEND THE SECTORS AND JOBS TO WHICH MINIMUM 
WAGE RULES APPLY, AND WILL INCREASE RESOURCES TO THE LABOUR INSPECTORATE TO 
ENSURE THAT WORKERS ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE WAGES THEY ARE DUE.  

28	WE WILL SET UP A REVIEW GROUP COMPOSED OF THE SOCIAL PARTNERS AND 
INDEPENDENT EXPERTS:

* TO EXAMINE AND QUANTIFY THE EXTENT OF LOW PAY IN THE ECONOMY IN 1997
* TO IDENTIFY THE SECTORS AND JOB TYPES WHERE LOW PAY IS PREVALENT, AND EVALUATE 
THE REASONS
* TO RECOMMEND A NATIONAL HOURLY NORM, TAKING ON BOARD DEVELOPMENTS IN THE 
UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER COMPETITIVE ISSUES.

29	THE NORM WILL INITIALLY BE A GUIDELINE FOR JLCS, THE COVERAGE OF WHICH 
WILL BE EXTENDED AS NECESSARY.  IN THE ABSENCE OF THE GUIDELINE BEING FOLLOWED, 
THE NATIONAL NORM WILL BE APPLIED BY LAW AFTER FURTHER CONSULTATION WITH THE 
SOCIAL PARTNERS.

30	WE WILL ALSO INCREASE RESOURCES TOWARDS ENHANCING THE TRAINING OF 
UNSKILLED WORKERS AS INCREASING EARNING POWER IS USUALLY THE KEY TO LONG-TERM 
INCREASES IN EARNINGS.

FAIRER TAXES

31	ON TAXATION, LABOUR WILL HONOUR THE COMMITMENTS IN PARTNERSHIP 2000, WHICH 
HAS NOW COMMENCED, AND WHICH TOTAL £900M OVER THREE YEARS IN PERSONAL TAX 
REDUCTION AND £100M IN CORPORATE TAXES.  ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL ALLOW THIS LEVEL 
OF REDUCTION TO CONTINUE.  

32	OUR OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO INCREASE THE AFTER TAX INCOME OF EVERY WORKER 
WELL ABOVE INFLATION, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THOSE ON OR BELOW THE AVERAGE 
INDUSTRIAL WAGE.

33	THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF HYPE ABOUT "HEADLINE" TAX RATES.  NO SINGLE 
PERSON OR MARRIED COUPLE TAKEN TOGETHER PAY 48% OF ALL THEIR INCOME - THEIR 
EFFECTIVE RATE IS FAR LOWER WHEN ACCOUNT IS TAKEN OF PERSONAL ALLOWANCES, THE 
WIDENED STANDARD RATE BAND, AND IN MANY CASES DISCRETIONARY ALLOWANCES. 

34	 WHAT MATTERS MOST IN THE END IS THE ACTUAL AMOUNT LEFT IN THE PAY PACKET 
- AND THAT IS DETERMINED BY THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TAX TAKEN BY THE EXCHEQUER. THE 
BEST MEASUREMENT OF ANY BALANCED TAX REDUCTION PACKAGE IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT 
REDUCES THE "TAX TAKE" IN OVERALL TERMS.

35	OUR APPROACH WILL BE TO FOCUS RELIEF ON THOSE WITH LOW AND MIDDLE INCOMES, 
MAINLY THROUGH CHANGES IN PERSONAL ALLOWANCES AND TAX BANDS. WE WILL ALSO 
EXAMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF  CHANGES IN RATES OR LEVIES.

LABOUR'S OBJECTIVE IN RELATION TO THE TAX TAKE IS:

_	TO ENSURE THAT A SINGLE PERSON ON THE AVERAGE INDUSTRIAL WAGE WOULD KEEP 
78% AND A MARRIED PERSON 86% OF THEIR PAY PACKETS.  

_	THEREFORE, THE AVERAGE TAX PAID (INCLUDING INCOME TAX, PRSI AND LEVIES) BY 
A SINGLE PERSON ON THE AVERAGE INDUSTRIAL WAGE AS IT INCREASES OVER THE YEARS 
WILL DROP TO 22% OF INCOME, AND FOR A MARRIED PERSON TO 14% OF INCOME.  

THIS IS BEFORE COUNTING ANY DISCRETIONARY ALLOWANCES SUCH AS RELIEF FOR 
MORTGAGES AND HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH LABOUR WILL MAINTAIN AT THE STANDARD RATE, 
AND WHICH REDUCE THE TAX DUE FROM MANY TAXPAYERS.  

36	IN THE CONTEXT OF PARTNERSHIP 2000, A CHANGE TO TAX CREDITS AND STANDARD 
RATING OF PERSONAL ALLOWANCES AS A WAY OF EQUALISING TAX RELIEF AND ALLOWANCES 
TO TAXPAYERS ON DIFFERENT MARGINAL RATES WILL BE EXAMINED IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
THE SOCIAL PARTNERS.  IF SUCH A SYSTEM WERE INTRODUCED, THE MONEY SAVED WOULD BE 
USED TO FUND OTHER PERSONAL TAX REDUCTIONS.

37	PERSONAL ALLOWANCES WILL BE INCREASED FASTER THAN EXEMPTION LIMITS FOR TAX 
TO EASE THE TRANSITION FOR THOSE ON LOW INCOMES ENTERING THE TAX NET.

38	THE PRSI EXEMPTION LIMIT OF £80 PER WEEK WILL BE INCREASED.

39	THE AGE ALLOWANCE FOR THOSE OVER 65 WILL AT LEAST BE DOUBLED WITHIN THE 
LIFE-TIME OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT.

40	IN LINE WITH ANNOUNCEMENTS ALREADY MADE, THE PROPORTION OF TOTAL TAX 
REVENUE, TAKEN IN CAPITAL TAXES, WILL BE MAINTAINED AT THE AVERAGE OF 1996 AND 
1997 LEVEL.  THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER SIGNIFICANT RELIEFS IN THE CAPITAL 
ACQUISITIONS TAX CODE, APART FROM EXISTING RELIEFS.

41	OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE STANDARD RATE OF COMPANY TAXATION WILL BE 
REDUCED, WITH THE OBJECT OF MOVING TOWARDS A FULLY HARMONISED RATE AFTER 2010.  
AT THE SAME TIME, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL SPECIAL TAX BREAKS FOR BUSINESS IN 
CREATING EMPLOYMENT  -  CAPITAL ALLOWANCES, BUSINESS EXPANSION SCHEMES, URBAN 
RENEWAL, AND MANY OTHERS WILL BE CAREFULLY EVALUATED.

42	LABOUR'S OBJECTIVE IS KEEP THE TAX TAKE FROM CORPORATIONS AT LEAST AT THE 
SAME PROPORTION OF TOTAL TAX REVENUE AS THE AVERAGE OF 1996 AND 1997.

43	THERE WILL BE NO MORE TAX AMNESTIES.  THE REVENUE AUTHORITIES WILL BE 
EXPECTED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO COUNTER TAX EVASION AND FRAUD, AND TO USE 
EXISTING LEGAL POWERS TO THE FULL IN PURSUING DEFAULTERS.

COMMERCIAL STATE-SPONSORED BODIES

44	WE SUPPORT A SIGNIFICANT ROLE FOR THE COMMERCIAL STATE-SPONSORED BODIES IN 
THE YEARS AHEAD.  MANY OF THESE HAVE BEEN TO THE FOREFRONT OF ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN IRELAND OVER THE YEARS; IN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND IN 
DEVELOPING OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES IN RURAL IRELAND.

45	AT PRESENT, AND INCREASINGLY IN THE FUTURE, STATE COMPANIES WILL BE 
SUBJECT  TO COMPETITION AT HOME AND ABROAD; THIS INVOLVES TRANSFORMING 
THEMSELVES INTO MODERN EFFICIENT ENTERPRISES. MANY OF THESE ENTERPRISES WITH THE 
CO-OPERATION OF THE TRADE UNIONS AND EMPLOYEES ARE NOW MANAGING THE ESSENTIAL 
CHANGES EFFECTIVELY.

46	THE FORCES OF COMPETITION NOW FACING OR ABOUT TO FACE STATE COMPANIES AND 
UTILITIES REQUIRES A NEW SYSTEM OF REGULATION WHICH WILL:
_ PROVIDE RULES OF FAIR COMPETITION
_ ESTABLISH REASONABLE LEVELS OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE
_ SET APPROPRIATE TARIFF LEVELS
_ PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY OF ACCOUNTS.
TO THIS END WE WILL ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT MULTI-SECTORAL UTILITY REGULATORY 
COMMISSION WHICH, INTER-ALIA, WILL TAKE OVER THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NEW DIRECTOR 
OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND THE REGULATORY FUNCTIONS OF THE MINISTER 
FOR HEALTH IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET.

47	LABOUR WILL RETAIN MAJORITY STATE OWNERSHIP IN THESE ENTERPRISES.  
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPANSION TO UTILISE THE ACCUMULATED BANK OF SKILLS WILL BE 
ENCOURAGED. SUITABLE JOINT VENTURES, AS IN THE CASE OF TELECOM EIREANN, AND 
PROBABLY IN OTHER COMPANIES, CAN BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PROCESS OF ENSURING 
SURVIVAL, GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 

48	 IT IS CRUCIAL THAT FLAGSHIP COMPANIES IN KEY STRATEGIC AREAS ARE 
MAINTAINED UNDER NATIONAL CONTROL THROUGH MAJORITY OWNERSHIP BY THE STATE.

49	LABOUR WILL SUPPORT IN APPROPRIATE CASES, THROUGH TAX CONCESSIONS AND IN 
OTHER WAYS, SCHEMES FOR EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDING PARTICIPATION, AND IN PARTICULAR 
MEASURES DESIGNED TO FACILITATE MINORITY SHAREHOLDINGS HELD BY A COLLECTIVE 
ENTITY ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES.  

50	IN THESE WAYS, A GENUINE PARTNERSHIP AND "STAKEHOLDING" CAN BE EVOLVED IN 
THESE COMPANIES TO THE LONG-TERM BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY, THE EXCHEQUER, AND THE 
WORKFORCE. 

51	 IDEOLOGICAL OPPOSITION AND PRIVATISATION AGENDAS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO 
STYMIE SUCH  DEVELOPMENTS.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

52	SIGNIFICANT SECTORS OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAVE BECOME MORE 
COMPETITIVE IN RESPONSE TO GLOBAL TRENDS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE SINGLE 
MARKET. IN THE CONTEXT OF EMU, AND GLOBALISATION GENERALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT THE 
BANKING SECTOR IS A KEY STRATEGIC AREA.  THAT IS WHY THE STATE SHOULD MAINTAIN A 
SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN THIS SECTOR.

53	WE PROPOSE A MAJOR REVIEW OF KEY ASPECTS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THIS 
REVIEW WOULD BE CARRIED OUT BY AN EXPERT GROUP WHICH WOULD REPORT TO THE 
GOVERNMENT WITHIN ONE YEAR.  

54	THE TERMS OF REFERENCE WOULD BE:

* TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RANGE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES OFFERED TO 
START-UP BUSINESSES,  AND TO SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ENTERPRISES, AND MAKE 
RECOMMENDATIONS AS NECESSARY.
* TO EXAMINE THE AVAILABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DELIVERY OF BANKING AND MONEY 
TRANSMISSION SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
* TO ASSESS THE NEEDS FOR BANKING AND MONEY TRANSMISSION SERVICES IN 
DISADVANTAGED AREAS AND 
* TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY WHICH WILL ENSURE THE MAXIMUM DEGREE OF PUBLIC AND 
COMMUNITY ACCESS TO THE MONEY TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. 
* TO EXAMINE THE REASONS WHY RETAIL, PLASTIC CARD BASED BANKING AND ELECTRONIC 
MONEY TRANSMISSION SERVICES CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT UTILISED MORE WIDELY.

GROWTH FROM THE SECTORS

55	LABOUR IS THE PARTY OF WORK AND THE PARTY OF ENTERPRISE.  WITHOUT 
ENTERPRISE IN THE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SECTOR, THERE IS NO WEALTH AND NO BASIS FOR 
SOCIAL PROGRESS.  LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO A STRONG MARKET ECONOMY BASED ON 
COMPETITION.  IN GOVERNMENT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE MEASURES WHICH:

_ STIMULATE EXPANSION BY ENCOURAGING INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE, TECHNOLOGY AND MARKET 
DEVELOPMENT


_ SECURE AN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CHARACTERISED BY A COMPETITIVE DYNAMIC 
AND WHOSE UTILITIES MEET THE BEST INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR PRICE AND QUALITY
_ ENABLE IRISH ENTERPRISE TO THRIVE, COMPETE AND PROSPER IN THE SINGLE EUROPEAN 
MARKET AND IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY.
_ GIVE EFFECT TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMPANY LAW REVIEW GROUP, BY 
ESTABLISHING NEW STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND WHICH WILL TOTALLY 
OVERHAUL ARCHAIC LAWS DEALING WITH COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN, TRADE MARKS AND 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

56	CURRENT SUCCESSFUL SECTORAL POLICIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY EU 
STRUCTURAL FUNDS, WILL BE CONTINUED  -  IN INDUSTRY, SERVICES, TOURISM, 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ENERGY, AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND OUR MARINE RESOURCES. AS 
DEVELOPED LATER IN THIS DOCUMENT, PRACTICES ACROSS ALL THE ECONOMIC SECTORS WILL 
NEED REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT INTO THE 
FUTURE.

INDUSTRY

57	THE GENERAL THRUST OF TAX, INCENTIVE, AND TRAINING POLICIES IS TO MAKE 
INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY INDIGENOUS INDUSTRY, MORE COMPETITIVE. THE AVAILABILITY OF 
EQUITY CAPITAL FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ENTERPRISES  (SMES) AT CRITICAL STAGES 
OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT WILL BE ADDRESSED. 

58	AT PRESENT, A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE ASSETS OF PENSION FUNDS ARE INVESTED 
ABROAD. PENSION FUNDS ARE AVERSE TO INVESTING IN UNQUOTED IRISH COMPANIES IN A 
GROWTH PHASE. LABOUR WILL DEVELOP A SUITABLE MECHANISM WHEREBY PENSION FUNDS ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO INVEST IN IRISH INDUSTRY.

59	OPTIONS BEING EXAMINED BY LABOUR INCLUDE:

_ THE PENSION FUNDS COMMITTING INITIALLY £40M OVER TIME TO TAKING EQUITY IN 
FIRMS THAT WOULD BE RECOMMENDED BY FORBAIRT.
_ FORBAIRT IDENTIFYING THE WELL DEVELOPED COMPANIES WHERE THEY HOLD EQUITY OR 
PREFERENCE SHARES, AND ESTABLISHING A SEPARATE "FORBAIRT FUND" TO BE JOINTLY 
OWNED BY FORBAIRT AND THE PENSION FUNDS.	

60	IRISH COMPANIES INVEST IN SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH AT ONLY HALF THE 
LEVEL OF THE OECD AVERAGE - WE CANNOT SUSTAIN SUCCESS IN THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED 
ECONOMY ON THIS BASIS.  

61	FUTURE STRATEGY IN PROVIDING GRANTS AND TAX INCENTIVES TO COMPANIES WILL 
EMPHASISE AS A PRIORITY INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT IN BOTH RESEARCH AND TRAINING. 
HIGHER EDUCATION AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES WILL BE RESOURCED AND ENCOURAGED TO 
PROVIDE A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF DIRECT SUPPORT IN RESEARCH, ANALYSIS, AND SKILLS 
DEVELOPMENT IN INDUSTRY.

AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

62	FARMING AND RELATED INDUSTRIES ARE THE BEDROCK OF MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES.  
DIRECT EMPLOYMENT IN AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND FORESTRY IS ABOUT 174,000 OR OVER 13% 
OF THE WORKFORCE, AND THESE SECTORS ACCOUNT FOR OVER A THIRD OF NET FOREIGN 
EARNINGS FROM TRADE. UNDER THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONAL PROGRAMME, 
CLOSE TO £300M IS BEING PROVIDED FROM NATIONAL AND EU FUNDS OVER THE PERIOD 1994 
- 1999.

63	LABOUR'S AIM IS TO DEVELOP THESE SECTORS IN A WAY THAT WILL MAXIMISE THEIR 
CONTRIBUTION TO EMPLOYMENT AND TO THE ECONOMY WITH DUE REGARD TO PROTECTING THE 
ENVIRONMENT.  ANY CHANGES IN EU POLICY MUST ONLY BE CARRIED THROUGH IN A MANNER 
WHICH PROTECTS THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF IRELAND'S FARMING AND RURAL 
COMMUNITIES AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY.

64	AT EU LEVEL, THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE THAT ANY REDUCTION IN AGRICULTURAL 
PRICES WILL BE COMPENSATED THROUGH DIRECT INCOME SUPPORTS FOR FARM FAMILIES.  IN 
THE MEDIUM-TERM, THE LIBERALISATION OF MARKETS AND WORLD TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WILL 
ACCENTUATE THE NEED FOR A DYNAMIC AND EFFICIENT AGRICULTURE CAPABLE OF 
WITHSTANDING COMPETITION FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE EU. IN THIS CONTEXT, LABOUR 
WILL SEEK TO ENSURE THAT ANY CHANGES IN SUPPORTS AND PROTECTION WILL BE GRADUAL, 
PHASED AND COMPENSATED.

65	THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORESTRY AND RELATED INDUSTRIES IS AN IMPORTANT 
PRIORITY.  LABOUR SUPPORTS THE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
FORESTRY SECTOR IN IRELAND PUBLISHED IN 1996,  WITH THE DOUBLING OF OUR PLANNED 
FOREST AREA OVER THE NEXT 40 YEARS, AND INCREASED JOB OPPORTUNITIES.

66	THERE IS A GROWING PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF 
INTENSIVE FARMING DEPENDENT ON EXCESSIVE USE OF FERTILIZERS, 
PESTICIDES/HERBICIDES AND OTHER CHEMICALS.  LABOUR FAVOURS THE PROMOTION OF 
ORGANIC FARMING WHICH MOVES AWAY FROM THE USE OF CHEMICALS AS AIDS TO PRODUCTION 
AND DEPENDS ON THE HARNESSING OF NATURE'S RESOURCES TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC.  STANDARDS WILL BE SET IN RELATION TO WHAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS 
ORGANIC, HEALTH OR HOME MADE FOODS.

67	A CERTIFICATION PROCEDURE WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO ENSURE THAT FOODS 
DESCRIBED AS HAVING BEEN PRODUCED ORGANICALLY WILL MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS.  A 
LICENSING SYSTEM WILL BE INTRODUCED TO ENSURE THAT THESE STANDARDS ARE MET. 
WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT STANDARDS ARE NOT ADHERED TO THERE WILL BE A 
MANDATORY WITHDRAWAL OF THE LICENCE.

FISHERIES & MARINE

68	LABOUR RECOGNISES THE ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT POTENTIAL OF IRELAND'S 
MARINE RESOURCES AND MARINE INDUSTRIES.  POLICY WILL FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF:
* SEA FISHERIES
* AQUACULTURE
* INLAND FISHERIES AND RELATED INDUSTRIES.

69	WE WILL VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THE CASE FOR A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN IRELAND'S 
ALLOCATION OF FISH STOCKS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMMON FISHERIES POLICY, 
HAVING REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.  WE WILL ENSURE THAT 
ACTION IS TAKEN AT EUROPEAN LEVEL TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT POSED TO OUR DOMESTIC 
FLEET BY SHIPS SAILING UNDER FLAGS OF CONVENIENCE.

TOURISM  

70	IRELAND HAS A RATE OF TOURISM GROWTH ALMOST FIVE TIMES THE EUROPEAN 
AVERAGE. THE CONTRIBUTION OF TOURISM TO THE ECONOMY IS REMARKABLE:

_ 4.7 MILLION VISITORS IN 1996 (UP 11%);
_ TOTAL EARNINGS OF £1.5 BILLION; 
_ 109,000 JOBS; 
_ A HALF-BILLION POUND CONTRIBUTION TO THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS. 

71	IN 1997, VISITOR NUMBERS WILL EXCEED 5 MILLION AND EMPLOYMENT WILL REACH 
115,000. INVESTMENT IN TOURISM, WITH EU SUPPORT, WILL TOTAL £650 MILLION.

72	TOURISM HAS THE CAPACITY TO BECOME IRELAND'S PREMIER ECONOMIC SECTOR. THIS 
WILL REQUIRE STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ADEQUATE FINANCIAL AND MARKETING SUPPORT. 
STRONG AND SUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT WILL REQUIRE A FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH 
INVESTMENT, MARKETING, RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING CAN BE FACILITATED AND 
ENCOURAGED.

73	LABOUR WILL PUT IN PLACE THE LONG-TERM STRATEGY NEEDED TO BUILD ON THE 
RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS. THIS STRATEGY WILL BE SET OUT IN A WHITE PAPER WITHIN THE 
NEXT YEAR, FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION WITH ALL RELEVANT INDUSTRY 
INTERESTS. THE TOURISM STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND 
WILL SET CLEAR TARGETS FOR GROWTH, EMPLOYMENT, INVESTMENT AND STANDARDS.

74	THE STRATEGY WILL INVOLVE:
* ACTION TO RETAIN ADEQUATE ERDF FUNDING AFTER 1999, BY EMPHASISING REGIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT, STRATEGIC MARKETING AND EMPLOYMENT / TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.
* MAINTENANCE OF HIGH LEVELS OF PRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT IN THE IRISH TOURISM 
PRODUCT THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN EXCHEQUER, PRIVATE SECTOR AND EU FUNDING.
* SUSTAINED OVERSEAS MARKETING EFFORT BY BORD F·ILTE IN THE OVERSEAS TOURISM 
MARKETING INITIATIVE PARTNERSHIP AND IN THE FRAMEWORK OF TOURISM BRAND IRELAND.
* PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ROLE OF TOURISM AS A FOCUS FOR 
INVESTMENT AND A SOURCE OF JOBS, WITH TARGETED INCENTIVES AND PROMOTIONAL 
SUPPORT.
* TACKLING THE SEASONALITY FACTOR BY SEEKING A MORE EVEN SPREAD OF BUSINESS AND 
JOB CREATION, PARTICULARLY BY BUILDING ON THE DOMESTIC TOURISM MARKETING 
INITIATIVE.
* PLANNED EXPANSION OF THE WORK FORCE WITH EMPHASIS ON THE QUALITY OF WORK, GOOD 
PAY AND CONDITIONS AND SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS TO OFFSET NEGATIVE FACTORS AFFECTING 
RECRUITMENT.
* PROVISION OF TRAINING AND RETRAINING TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF SERVICE 
AND PROFESSIONALISM; WITH POLICIES OF PARTICIPATION, INFORMATION AND 
CONSULTATION.
* EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING IN THE PROVISION OF A TOURISM 
PRODUCT WHICH WILL SUCCEED IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WORLD AND EUROPEAN SETTING.
* ATTENTION TO THE IMPLICATIONS FOR TOURISM GROWTH OF THE TAX SYSTEM; 
MAINTENANCE OF THE LOWER VAT RATES FOR KEY ITEMS; TARGETED TAX INCENTIVES FOR 
INVESTMENT.
* RECOGNITION THAT TOURISM MUST BE DEVELOPED IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE 
MANNER; AGRI-TOURISM AND URBAN RENEWAL PROGRAMMES WILL BE GIVEN PRIORITY.
* SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF KEY TOURISM PRODUCTS; LEISURE AND 
RECREATIONAL FACILITIES; CULTURAL ACTIVITIES AND SPECIALIST PROVISIONS (ANGLING 
ETC.)
* PLANNED EXPANSION OF THE ACCESS INFRASTRUCTURE WITH PRIORITY FOR THE REGIONAL 
DIMENSION AND CROSS BORDER LINKS; PROVISION OF A NATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTRE.
* CO-ORDINATION OF THE PUBLIC BODIES IN THE SECTOR; BORD F·ILTE; SFADCO; 
REGIONAL TOURISM ORGANISATIONS; LOCAL AUTHORITIES; SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY TOURISM 
INITIATIVES.

* STRENGTHENING THE TOURISM COUNCIL AS THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE INDUSTRY 
AS A WHOLE AND AS THE FORUM FOR AGREED STRATEGIES FOR ALL SECTORS OF THE 
INDUSTRY.
* RATIONALISATION OF GOVERNMENT LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO TOURISM.

75	TOURISM HOLDS OUT THE PROSPECT OF REAL AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN A SECTOR 
WHICH COULD BECOME THE FLAGSHIP OF IRISH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, BASED AS IT IS ON 
SO MUCH THAT IS BEST IN OUR COUNTRY. 
76	IT HAS EMERGED FROM ITS EARLIER IMAGE AS A POOR, SEASONAL SUBSTITUTE FOR 
MORE HIGHLY RATED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. IT NOW REPRESENTS A HIGH QUALITY, 
PROFESSIONAL SECTOR IN WHICH A GREAT DEAL OF INVESTMENT IN BOTH PRODUCT AND 
PERSONNEL IS PAYING OFF IN TERMS OF INCOME AND JOBS.

CONCLUSION

77	LABOUR HAS OUTLINED ABOVE ITS LONG-TERM AND FOCUSED STRATEGY FOR THE 
FUTURE. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES 
CANNOT BE OVERESTIMATED. 

78	THERE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO SET NEW STANDARDS ACROSS THE 
SPECTRUM OF SERVICES AND HUMAN RESOURCES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE 
STRATEGY AS A CLEAR PRIORITY.

COHESION 
THROUGH 
PARTNERSHIP

INTRODUCTION

1	THE POLICIES AND COMMITMENT NEEDED TO TACKLE OUR EMPLOYMENT PROBLEM 
REQUIRE CONSENSUS, A SHARED VISION AND A LONG-TERM APPROACH. OUR OVER-RIDING AIM 
IS AN ECONOMY WHERE MORE PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY SKILLED AND IN WELL PAID JOBS. AT THE 
SAME TIME WE HAVE TO INTENSIFY THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY, AGAINST PERSISTENT 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND DEPRIVATION.          

2	IN ENSURING ECONOMIC GROWTH AT A HIGH LEVEL, WE MUST ALSO ACHIEVE MORE 
EQUALITY IN DISTRIBUTING THE FRUITS OF GROWTH.  OUR AIM IS TO BUILD A COHESIVE 
AND CONFIDENT SOCIETY. THAT MEANS AN INCLUSIVE PARTNERSHIP ECONOMY BUILT ON HIGH 
SKILLS, HIGH WAGES, SOCIAL INCLUSIVENESS AND ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION.

3	LABOUR PIONEERED THE CONCEPT OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC & SOCIAL FORUM. IT  
HAS BEEN, AND CONTINUES TO BE, A VITAL MECHANISM FOR DEVELOPING AND HIGHLIGHTING 
POLICY CONCERNS WHICH COULD OTHERWISE RANK LOW IN PRIORITY.
4	THIS WAS MOST EVIDENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF  "PARTNERSHIP 2000". GROUPS 
REPRESENTING THE UNEMPLOYED, ELDERLY PEOPLE, WOMEN AND SEVERAL OTHER COMMUNITY 
AND NATIONAL ORGANISATIONS JOINED ON AN EQUAL BASIS, FOR THE FIRST TIME, IN A 
CRITICAL DIALOGUE WITH THE TRADITIONAL SOCIAL PARTNERS. 

5	AS A RESULT, THERE WAS A WIDENING OF THE AGENDA, IN THE WEIGHT GIVEN TO 
ISSUES VITAL TO THE "THIRD STRAND GROUPS", AND IN THE QUALITY OF THE OUTCOME. IN 
ADDITION, MANY OF THE REPORTS PRODUCED BY THE NESF HAVE PROVED TO BE VITAL 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO NATIONAL POLICY.  WE CONSIDER THAT IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT 
TO ENSURE THAT THE NESF CONTINUES TO PLAY ITS INCREASINGLY CENTRAL ROLE IN ANY 
FUTURE GOVERNMENT.

6	WE VALUE THE CONTRIBUTION OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS, COMMUNITY 
GROUPS, VOLUNTARY YOUTH SERVICES AND OTHER LOCAL INITIATIVES IN THE PURSUIT OF 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL GOALS.  SUCH POSITIVE ACTIVITIES WILL BE GIVEN APPROPRIATE 
RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT.

TACKLING SOCIAL EXCLUSION

7	IT IS ALSO VITAL THAT THE NEXT GOVERNMENT ENDORSES, AND SETS ABOUT 
IMPLEMENTING,  THE OBJECTIVES OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-POVERTY STRATEGY LAUNCHED IN 
APRIL 1997.  THE SPECIFIC TARGETS IT SETS ACROSS A NUMBER OF KEY POLICY AREAS 
ARE ESSENTIAL TO ANY PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIAL INCLUSION.

8	INCOME SUPPORT AND SOCIAL WELFARE PROVISIONS MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH THE 
TARGET SET FOR POVERTY REDUCTION.  THERE MUST BE A COHERENT STRATEGY FOR 
TACKLING URBAN DISADVANTAGE, AND SPECIFIC STRATEGIES FOR THE PROVISION OF 
SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS, ESPECIALLY THOSE CONCERNED WITH EDUCATIONAL 
DISADVANTAGE, UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCOME ADEQUACY.

9	WE INTEND TO ENSURE THE HONOURING IN FULL OF THE COMMITMENT IN PARTNERSHIP 
2000 OF EXPENDITURE OF £525M ON A FULL YEAR COST BASIS ON SOCIAL INCLUSION 
MEASURES DURING THE PERIOD OF THE NEW PARTNERSHIP.  THIS WILL PROTECT THE REAL 
VALUE OF SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS AND PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN 
ENHANCING INCLUSION.

10	HONOURING THOSE COMMITMENTS WILL  INVOLVE, FOR EXAMPLE:
* CONTINUAL INCREASES IN CHILD BENEFIT, WHICH HAVE BEEN NEARLY DOUBLED FOR MANY 
FAMILIES DURING THE PERIOD LABOUR HAS BEEN IN GOVERNMENT.
* A CONTINUING FOCUS ON THE FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT (FIS) AS A MEANS OF 
INCREASING THE NET RETURN FROM WORK TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, INCLUDING 
CALCULATING FIS ON A NET INCOME BASIS.
* ACTIVE LABOUR MARKET MEASURES, WITH BETTER PATHWAYS WITHIN EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING AND TARGETING SECTORS OF THE UNEMPLOYED, PARTICULARLY THE LONG-TERM 
UNEMPLOYED.
* AN INCREASE OF 10,000 ON COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMMES AND RELATED OPTIONS: 
WE WILL PRIORITISE RESOURCES TOWARDS THIS AIM IN THE PERIOD AHEAD.
* A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC MEASURES AIMED AT MEETING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH 
DISABILITIES, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SERVICE GAPS AT PRESENT.

SOCIAL GUARANTEE

11	AN ABUNDANT ECONOMY MUST BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE A SOCIETY WHERE CHOICES 
ARE MADE, AND RIGHTS ARE EXERCISED, ON THE BASIS OF HOPE AND DIGNITY, AND NOT ON 
THE BASIS OF DEPENDENCE OR CHARITY.

12	ONE WAY OF ACHIEVING THIS GOAL IS A SOCIAL GUARANTEE.  THE SOCIAL 
GUARANTEE RECOGNISES THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN GROUPS IN SOCIETY WHO ARE, BECAUSE 
OF AN INABILITY TO EXERCISE THE FULL RANGE OF RIGHTS, IN A DEPENDENT STATE.  THE 
SOCIAL GUARANTEE AIMS TO END THAT CONDITION.

13	IN THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM, WE PROPOSE TO APPLY THE SOCIAL GUARANTEE TO 
THREE GROUPS OF PEOPLE:  YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGE OF 18 AND 21;  PEOPLE WITH 
A DISABILITY; AND OLDER PEOPLE.

YOUNG PEOPLE

14	YOUNG PEOPLE OF 18 CAN VOTE AND CAN GET MARRIED AND START A FAMILY.  IN 
FACT THEY ARE OBLIGED TO BE RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. WE BELIEVE THEY 
SHOULD BE PREPARING TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR FULL TALENTS TO THE COMMUNITY.  

15	RECEIVING A STATE WELFARE PAYMENT - WHICH DEPENDS ON NOT BEING AVAILABLE 
FOR EMPLOYMENT - IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE PREPARATION. 
16	IN THIS MANIFESTO, AMONG OTHER THINGS,  LABOUR IS PROPOSING AN EDUCATION 
STRATEGY, AN ECONOMIC INVESTMENT STRATEGY, AND A CRIME PREVENTION STRATEGY.  
17	BUT MOST OF ALL, WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS AN INVESTMENT TO COMBAT SOCIAL 
EXCLUSION.  WE ARE GUARANTEEING A START TO ADULT LIFE WITH HOPE AND VALID 
EXPECTATIONS.  SUCH A GUARANTEE IS AN OFFER THAT TREATS YOUNG PEOPLE AS 
RESPONSIBLE ADULTS. 


OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT 100% OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE COMPLETE SECOND LEVEL 
EDUCATION. WHEN THEY DO, THE OPTIONS OPEN TO THEM SHOULD INCLUDE:

_	GOING ON TO THIRD LEVEL, 
_	TAKING UP TRAINING, TRAINEESHIPS,  OR APPRENTICESHIPS, 
_	GETTING CONVENTIONAL PAID EMPLOYMENT, 
_	TAKING UP SELF-EMPLOYMENT, 
_	DOING COMBINED TRAINING/WORK OR
_	WORKING IN THEIR COMMUNITY FOR PAY.

18	OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO GUARANTEE THAT EVERY YOUNG PERSON AGED 18 TO 21 WILL 
HAVE A WORTHWHILE OFFER OF EDUCATION, TRAINING, CONVENTIONAL EMPLOYMENT OR 
COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT. 

19	AS THE PROCESS DEVELOPS AND PLACES BECOME AVAILABLE, THIS OFFER WILL 
INVOLVE GRADUALLY RAISING THE AGE LIMIT FOR UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE AND 
SUPPLEMENTARY WELFARE ALLOWANCES TO 21.  IT WILL NOT CHANGE ENTITLEMENT TO 
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT WHICH ONLY BECOMES PAYABLE AFTER A PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT. IT 
WILL NOT AFFECT ENTITLEMENT TO DISABILITY RELATED PAYMENTS.
20	WE HAVE REACHED THE STAGE WHERE 84% OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE COMPLETE SECOND 
LEVEL EDUCATION. WE WANT TO HAVE 100% REACH THAT STAGE. ACHIEVING THIS WILL NOT 
BE EASY.  THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THOSE WHO DROP OUT HAVE, IN GENERAL, LOW 
ACHIEVEMENT AND HIGH ABSENTEE LEVELS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL FOLLOWED BY LOW 
ACHIEVEMENT IN SECONDARY.  

21	THE PROBLEM HAS TO BE ADDRESSED AT PRIMARY LEVEL INITIALLY. WE PROPOSES, 
INITIALLY, VERY SPECIFIC TARGETING OF PRE-SCHOOLS AND PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN THE 
MOST DISADVANTAGED AREAS AND FOLLOW UP FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO TO 
SECONDARY SCHOOL.  

22	FOR THOSE WHO LEAVE SCHOOL BEFORE AGE 18, THE NEW EDUCATION BOARDS WOULD 
PROVIDE A WELFARE AND COUNSELLING SERVICE.  THIS WOULD INVOLVE TRACING OF DROP-
OUTS, PROVISION OF ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION/TRAINING, AND MENTORING DURING SECOND 
LEVEL.  SCHOOLS WILL BE GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOTIFYING THE WELFARE SERVICE 
AS SOON AS A STUDENT HAS STOPPED ATTENDING, TO ENSURE THERE IS NO TIME LAG IN 
FOLLOWING UP THOSE WHO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL, AND OFFERING THEM A PATHWAY BACK INTO 
LEARNING.

23	BETWEEN 18 AND 21 THE SOCIAL GUARANTEE WOULD OPERATE TO ENSURE CONTINUING 
EDUCATION OR TRAINING OR EMPLOYMENT. 

24	FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DO NOT GO ONTO THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION OR GET 
CONVENTIONAL EMPLOYMENT, I.E. THOSE WHO CURRENTLY APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT 
ASSISTANCE, WE WOULD SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE THAT:

* THE HIGHER EDUCATION MAINTENANCE GRANTS WOULD BE EXTENDED TO STUDENTS 
ATTENDING PLCS

* A SPECIFIC TRAINING PROGRAMME FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LEFT SCHOOL EARLY WOULD BE 
ESTABLISHED IN THE COMMUNITY, INVOLVING COMMUNITY GROUPS, PARTNERSHIPS AND 
PARENTS.  THIS PROGRAMME WOULD INITIALLY TRY TO COMPENSATE FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS 
OF EACH INDIVIDUAL'S EDUCATION BEFORE MOVING ON TO SPECIFIC TRAINING.  TRAINING 
ALLOWANCES WOULD BE PAID ALONG THE LINES OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION MAINTENANCE 
GRANTS SCHEME.

* JOB PLACEMENT ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE MADE WITH THE CO-OPERATION OF INDUSTRY AND 
THE SERVICES SECTOR THROUGH SPECIFIC YOUTH PLACEMENT OFFICERS IN THE LOCAL 
EMPLOYMENT SERVICE AT THE GOING RATE FOR YOUNG TRAINEES IN THE JOB.

* COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE MADE WITH PARTNERSHIPS AND LOCAL 
VOLUNTARY GROUPS TO PROVIDE FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT AT THE GOING RATE FOR THE JOB.

25	THE SOCIAL GUARANTEE TO YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD BE PHASED IN, WITH A TARGET OF 
BEING FULLY IN PLACE IN 3 YEARS. INITIALLY IT WOULD APPLY TO 18 YEAR OLDS AND 
THE AGE LIMIT FOR UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE COULD BE RAISED TO 19.

26	THE SOCIAL GUARANTEE WOULD COVER YOUNG PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO WOULD 
BE GUARANTEED OFFERS OF EDUCATION/TRAINING/ WORK OPPORTUNITIES APPROPRIATE TO 
EACH INDIVIDUAL AS PER THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.  
27	INCOME MAINTENANCE SCHEMES SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE 
TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR COPING BETWEEN JOBS OR FOR SUPPLEMENTING INCOME FROM 
VOLUNTARY PART-TIME WORK AND PRECARIOUS SELF-EMPLOYMENT.  THEY SHOULD NOT 
CONSTITUTE THE FIRST INDEPENDENT INCOME OF ANY PERSON.  

28	STARTING ADULT LIFE ON UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE IS NOT THE FUTURE WE 
ENVISAGE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.  AN ABUNDANT ECONOMY PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
START OUT LIFE IN HOPE AND PURPOSEFULNESS, NOT IN DEPENDENCE.

29	THE QUALITY OF OFFERS TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE QUALITY SERVICE TO THEM BY 
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES IN COUNSELLING FOLLOW-UP AND 
ENCOURAGEMENT WILL BE OF VITAL IMPORTANCE.  LABOUR'S AIM  IS TO ENSURE THE 
GUARANTEE WILL BE PHASED IN WITH SENSITIVITY AND CAREFUL PLANNING.

PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY

30	WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OVER TIME OF THE REPORT OF THE 
COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE ESTABLISHED THE 
COMMISSION, AND MERVYN TAYLOR HAS ALREADY BEGUN WORK IN ENSURING AN APPROPRIATE 
AND AGREED SET OF PRIORITIES.   WE WILL BE CONSULTING WITH THE IRISH COUNCIL OF 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THROUGHOUT  THIS PROCESS.

31	WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING THE REPORT "TOWARDS AN INDEPENDENT 
FUTURE", AND IN PARTICULAR WE WILL DEVELOP THE CONCEPT OF INDEPENDENT LIVING, 
WITH ITS EMPHASIS ON AN INDEPENDENT LIVING FUND. 

32	THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF THESE REPORTS - AN OBJECTIVE WHICH LABOUR FULLY 
SHARES - IS THE PROVISION OF A HIGH-QUALITY AND FULLY ACCESSIBLE RANGE OF 
SERVICES FROM THE MOMENT OF ONSET OF A DISABILITY.  

33	SUCH SERVICES MUST BE AVAILABLE ON THE BASIS OF NEED, AND MUST FACILITATE 
THE MAXIMUM DEGREE OF INDEPENDENCE AND PERSONAL AUTONOMY. THEY MUST BE SHAPED 
AND GEARED TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS AND TALENTS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THEY 
MUST BE AVAILABLE AS OF RIGHT, AND NOT DEPENDENT ON CHARITY. IN SHORT, THEY MUST 
BE THE SUBJECT OF A SOCIAL GUARANTEE.


A SOCIAL GUARANTEE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WOULD END THIS AND OTHER 
ANOMALIES. IT WOULD SEEK TO ENSURE THAT, FROM THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, DIAGNOSIS, OR 
ONSET OF THE DISABILITY, THE FOLLOWING SERVICES WOULD BE GUARANTEED:

_ DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT;
_ COUNSELLING (INCLUDING COUNSELLING FOR CARERS WHERE NECESSARY);
_ A FULL RANGE OF MEDICAL SERVICES AS REQUIRED;
_ EDUCATION AND TRAINING BASED ON THE RIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO ASPIRE TO HIS 
OR HER FULL POTENTIAL, AND TO LIVE AND WORK IN MAINSTREAM SOCIETY;
_ OPEN, SUPPORTED OR SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT AS APPROPRIATE, IN A DECENT 
ENVIRONMENT AND WITHIN REASONABLE ACCESS FROM HOME;
_ RESIDENTIAL CARE WHEN NEEDED, AND THE GUARANTEE OF A HOME LIFE IN PROPER AND 
SUPPORTIVE SURROUNDINGS;
_ RESPITE CARE WHEN REQUIRED;
_ ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC TRANSPORT.


34	HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS ARE ALREADY INVESTED IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES FOR 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IN TOO MANY CASES THESE FUNDS ARE NOT WELL-ENOUGH 
DIRECTED, AND TOO OFTEN REFLECT THE NEEDS OF  AGENCIES RATHER THAN THE NEEDS OF 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE DEEMED 
INELIGIBLE FOR TRAINING - NOT BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM THE TRAINING, 
BUT BECAUSE THEIR INCLUSION MIGHT JEOPARDISE THE ATTRACTION OF MATCHING FUNDS 
FROM EUROPEAN FUNDS.

35	THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONE-STOP SHOPS, AS ENVISAGED IN THE CONCEPT OF THE 
DISABILITY SUPPORT SERVICE PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION, WILL GO SOME WAY TOWARDS 
MEETING THE INFORMATION GAPS THAT ARE OFTEN A BARRIER TO THE SUPPLY OF SERVICES. 

36	 BUT THE SOCIAL GUARANTEE WILL ALSO REQUIRE SOME RESTRUCTURING OF 
SERVICES, MUCH GREATER CO-OPERATION BETWEEN AGENCIES, AND A STRONG POLITICAL 
COMMITMENT.  IMPLEMENTING THE SOCIAL GUARANTEE MEANS STARTING FROM THE 
PERSPECTIVE OF THE RIGHTS AND NEEDS OF THE PERSON, AND ADAPTING THE SERVICES TO 
MEET THOSE NEEDS.  

OLDER PEOPLE 

37	FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE, THE ATTAINMENT OF RETIREMENT AGE IS 
WELCOME.  FOR SOME, HOWEVER, RETIREMENT COINCIDES WITH ILLNESS OR INFIRMITY, 
STRESS, LONELINESS, OR POVERTY. A SOCIAL GUARANTEE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY 
WOULD MEAN RECOGNISING THAT A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN MADE THROUGHOUT 
A PERSON'S WORKING LIFE, AND THAT THERE IS A RIGHT TO DIGNITY, COMFORT AND 
SUPPORT IN OLD AGE.  

38	THE SOCIAL GUARANTEE FOR OLDER PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY WILL MEAN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF SOME NEW SERVICES OVER TIME, AND THE RADICAL UPGRADING OF OTHERS, 
ESPECIALLY THOSE AIMED AT PROVIDING HELP IN THE HOME.  

SPECIFICALLY, A SOCIAL GUARANTEE WOULD AIM TO ENSURE:

_ COUNSELLING AND RETIREMENT PREPARATION SERVICES ARE READILY AVAILABLE;
_ ACCOMMODATION NEEDS ARE FULLY MET;
_ NO ELDERLY PERSON WOULD BE FORCED TO LIVE IN ISOLATION FROM THE COMMUNITY;
_ NO ELDERLY PERSON WOULD LIVE IN FEAR, OR BE FORCED TO HIDE MODEST ASSETS 
THROUGH FEAR OF EXCESSIVE CLAW-BACK BY THE STATE;
_ ILLNESS WOULD NOT LEAD TO THE ELIMINATION OF LIFE-SAVINGS;
_ RECOVERY FROM ILLNESS WOULD BE SUPPORTED, AT HOME WHEN POSSIBLE OR THROUGH 
DECENT RECUPERATION FACILITIES.

39	WE ARE PROPOSING THAT A MINISTER OF STATE WOULD BE APPOINTED TO THE 
DEPARTMENTS OF EQUALITY AND LAW REFORM, HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN THE NEXT 
GOVERNMENT, WITH SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPING THE SOCIAL 
GUARANTEE FOR OLDER PEOPLE. 

GENDER EQUALITY 

40	OUR SOCIETY'S CULTURE AND ECONOMY STILL RETAIN A STRONG ASSOCIATION OF 
WOMEN WITH PRIVATE LIFE AND ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY, AND MEN WITH PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND 
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. POWER IS STILL DISPROPORTIONATELY CONFERRED ON THOSE WITH 
DIRECT ACCESS TO MONEY, AS COMPARED WITH THOSE WHO ARE  DEPENDENT ON OTHERS. 
THAT IS WHY STRATEGIES ARE NECESSARY TO END STILL EXISTING DISCRIMINATION 
AGAINST WOMEN.

41	WE WILL CONTINUE THE WORK OF IMPLEMENTING THE REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON 
THE STATUS OF WOMEN - 80% OF WHICH HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR PUT IN TRAIN BY 
LABOUR IN GOVERNMENT.

42	LATER IN THIS DOCUMENT, WE WILL BE DEALING WITH THE OUT-DATED 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS WHICH IMPLY A RESTRICTED POSITION FOR WOMEN IN THE 
HOME. CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED BY PRACTICAL AND CONCRETE 
MEASURES. 

43	WE PROPOSE TO GIVE PRACTICAL EXPRESSION TO CHANGE, BY THE FOLLOWING 
MEASURES, AMONG OTHERS:

* IN ADDITION TO THE PLANNED INCREASE IN CHILD BENEFIT RATES ALREADY REFERRED 
TO, WE PROPOSE THE INTRODUCTION OF A DOUBLE MONTHLY PAYMENT AT TIMES WHEN NEED 
WILL GENERALLY INCREASE - AUGUST AND DECEMBER - TO CATER FOR CHILDREN GOING BACK 
TO SCHOOL, AND FOR CHRISTMAS. 

* WE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND CHILD CARE FACILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY. ALREADY, 
A PILOT SCHEME OF 80 CHILD CARE PROJECTS IS IN OPERATION, WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT 
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EQUALITY AND LAW REFORM. OUR AIM WILL BE TO EXPAND THIS 
SCHEME TO A NATION-WIDE SERVICE.

* WE WILL INTRODUCE PARENTAL LEAVE LEGISLATION, AND ENCOURAGE ITS UPTAKE BY 
FATHERS.

* ENCOURAGEMENT OF FAMILY-FRIENDLY WORK PATTERNS FOR BOTH PARENTS, AND THE 
IMPLEMENTATION THROUGHOUT THE PUBLIC SECTOR OF THE FLEXIBLE JOB-SHARING 
PROPOSALS DEVELOPED BY EITHNE FITZGERALD.

* IN CONSULTATION WITH EDUCATION PARTNERS, WE WILL EXAMINE SCHOOL HOURS, THE 
PROVISION OF SAFE STUDY FACILITIES, AND THE TIMING OF HOLIDAYS AND HALF-TERM 
BREAKS, WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THEM MORE SUPPORTIVE OF WORKING PARENTS.

44	IN ADDITION, WE INTEND TO PURSUE THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES:

* A GENDER EQUALITY POLICY IN ALL AREAS OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM

* IN ADDITION TO EXISTING RIGHTS UNDER THE SUCCESSION ACT, A SURVIVING SPOUSE 
WILL ALSO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC FULL RIGHT TO THE FAMILY HOME AND CONTENTS

* EXAMINATION OF THE FEASIBILITY OF MAKING THE ENFORCEMENT OF MAINTENANCE ORDERS 
THE DUTY OF THE STATE, NOT THE PETITIONER - WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF AN 
AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMME EXTENDING TO THE SELF-EMPLOYED TO ENSURE PAYMENT 
OF ORDERS.

* THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN.

* THE RE-ENFORCEMENT OF THE GENDER BALANCE POLICY FOR STATE BOARDS AND AGENCIES, 
WHICH HAS ALREADY DOUBLED THE REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN ON SUCH BOARDS.


LAW REFORMS

45	THE DEPARTMENT OF EQUALITY AND LAW REFORM WILL BE CHARGED WITH A 
CONTINUING PROGRAMME OF LAW REFORM AND CONSOLIDATION. MEASURES WILL INCLUDE:

* CONSOLIDATION AND REFORM OF LEGISLATION ON REGISTRATION OF BIRTHS, MARRIAGES, 
AND DEATHS.

* A CONTINUAL PROGRAMME OF FAMILY LAW REFORM.

* ESTABLISHMENT OF FAMILY COURTS BASED ON THE LAW REFORM COMMISSION REPORT.

* PLACING THE FAMILY MEDIATION SERVICE ON A STATUTORY BASIS.

* LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE FOR WIDER RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN DIVORCES.

* CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO ENSURING AND ENFORCING EFFECTIVE ANTI- DISCRIMINATION 
AND EQUALITY LAWS IN THE WORK PLACE AND THE WIDER SOCIETY. WE AIM TO REMOVE ALL 
DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, MARITAL OR FAMILY 
STATUS, RACE, RELIGION, AGE, DISABILITY OR MEMBERSHIP OF THE TRAVELLING 
COMMUNITY. TO THIS END, WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE EMPLOYMENT EQUALITY BILL IS RE-
ENACTED, WITH WHATEVER MIMIMAL CHANGES ARE NECESSARY, WHILE PRESERVING ITS 
ESSENTIAL CHARACTER.

TRAVELLERS

46	IT IS ESTIMATED THAT SLIGHTLY OVER 1,000 TRAVELLER HOUSEHOLDS LIVE ON THE 
ROADSIDE AND ANOTHER 257 FAMILIES ON TEMPORARY SITES. MANY SITES ARE WITHOUT 
BASIC SERVICES WHICH MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED.  

47	INFANT AND ADULT MORTALITY RATES ARE OVER TWICE THOSE OF THE SETTLED 
COMMUNITY. THE GENERAL HEALTH STATUS OF TRAVELLERS IS MUCH LOWER. 

48	PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATION IS ALSO FAR LOWER, PARTICULARLY AT SECOND AND 
THIRD LEVEL. PARTICIPATION IN THE MAINSTREAM LABOUR FORCE IS MINIMAL AND THERE 
IS A HIGH LEVEL  OF UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG TRAVELLERS.

49	IN RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON THE TRAVELLING COMMUNITY, 
APPOINTED BY MERVYN TAYLOR, THE GOVERNMENT APPROVED A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF 
ACTIONS AND SERVICES TO BE PUT IN PLACE.  

50	THIS WORK IS ONGOING AND LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO THE DEDICATION OF 
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE PROGRESSIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PLAN. 

51	 RESPONSIBILITIES ARE BORNE BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT - ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH, 
EDUCATION AND EQUALITY & LAW REFORM - AS WELL AS LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WITH THE 
PARTICIPATION AND INVOLVEMENT OF TRAVELLERS' REPRESENTATIVES AND VOLUNTARY 
AGENCIES.

52	THE FIVE- YEAR STRATEGY FOR TRAVELLER ACCOMMODATION IS A NATIONAL 
PROGRAMME FOR THE PROVISION OF 3,100 UNITS OF ACCOMMODATION.  THE PLANNED 
HOUSING MIX WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 900 HOUSES; PERMANENT HALTING SITES 
(1,200 SERVICED BAYS), AND A NETWORK OF 1,000 SERVICED TRANSIENT HALTING SITES.

* A NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE GROUP, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF TRAVELLER 
INTERESTS AND OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES, WILL BE ESTABLISHED ON A STATUTORY BASIS TO 
MONITOR THE PREPARATION, ADEQUACY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCAL ACCOMMODATION 
PLANS.  
* EACH LOCAL AUTHORITY WILL BE REQUIRED BY LAW, FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH 
LOCAL TRAVELLER ACCOMMODATION COMMITTEES, TO DRAW UP AND ADOPT SUCH A PLAN 
WITHIN SPECIFIED DEADLINES, AS PART OF THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME.  
* IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT IN ADOPTION OF LOCAL PLANS, THE MINISTER FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT WILL BE EMPOWERED TO FORMALLY MAKE THE PLAN AND SECURE ITS 
IMPLEMENTATION AS AN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION OF THE LOCAL COUNCIL.
* AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS STRATEGY, LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE GIVEN WIDER 
POWERS TO DEAL WITH ILLEGAL, INDISCRIMINATE AND UNAUTHORISED PARKING BY 
TRAVELLERS AND OTHERS.

53	LABOUR SUPPORTS AN INTEGRATED PACKAGE OF ACTION: WITHOUT THE PROVISION OF 
ADEQUATE DEDICATED ACCOMMODATION, IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTH 
SERVICES WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERTAKE.  

54	FOLLOWING ON ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION, TRAVELLERS WILL BE ENABLED 
TO PARTICIPATE MORE FULLY IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOTH THROUGH THE GROWTH OF THE 
TRAVELLER ECONOMY AND BY GREATER PARTICIPATION IN THE MAINSTREAM LABOUR FORCE, 
SO THAT THE NATURAL SELF-RELIANCE OF THIS COMMUNITY WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO 
DEVELOP.  THESE MEASURES LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS BETWEEN 
TRAVELLERS AND THE SETTLED COMMUNITY.

BASIC INCOME

55	SUPPORTED BY RESEARCHES AND PUBLICATIONS BY CORI, A DEBATE IS IN TRAIN ON 
THE MERITS OF A BASIC INCOME SYSTEM.  A BASIC INCOME IS AN INCOME THAT IS 
UNCONDITIONALLY GRANTED TO ALL ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IT WOULD BE PAID TO 
INDIVIDUALS RATHER THAN TO HOUSEHOLDS, IRRESPECTIVE OF INCOME FROM ANY OTHER 
SOURCES, AND WITHOUT REQUIRING THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY WORK OR THE WILLINGNESS TO 
ACCEPT A JOB IF OFFERED ONE.

56	A BASIC INCOME SYSTEM WHETHER INTRODUCED ALL AT ONCE, IN STAGES BY 
DIFFERENT GROUPS, OR ON A PHASED IMPLEMENTATION BASIS WOULD BE PROFOUNDLY 
RADICAL. IT WOULD INVOLVE IN PRACTICE THE ENTIRE RESTRUCTURING OF THE EXISTING 
PERSONAL TAX AND WELFARE SYSTEMS.

57	LABOUR WELCOMES THE EMERGING DEBATE ON BASIC INCOME. THERE ARE STRONG 
ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR: INCLUDING THE OBJECT OF A MORE EQUAL INCOME DISTRIBUTION 
AND EQUITY, SIMPLICITY, AND THE REMOVAL OF POVERTY TRAPS. SERIOUS ISSUES ARISE 
WITH THE SINGLE HIGH INCOME TAX RATE THAT IS PART OF THE PROPOSALS, THE NATURE 
OF THE IMPACT ON THE LABOUR MARKET, AND THE NECESSITY FOR MORE PUBLIC 
INVOLVEMENT IN ASSESSING THE CASE FOR AND AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES 
INVOLVED.

58	WE ARE PROPOSING THAT  A GREEN PAPER BE PUBLISHED ON THIS SUBJECT WITHIN 
ONE YEAR.  IT SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY FURTHER PUBLIC DEBATE, AND WITH FULL 
INPUTS FROM BOTH THE PROPONENTS AND CRITICS OF THE PROPOSAL FOR A BASIC INCOME.

HOUSING

59	LABOUR'S OBJECTIVE IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IS PROVIDED WITH DECENT 
ACCOMMODATION AT A REASONABLE COST.

60	WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE HIGH PRICE OF NEW HOUSING IN CERTAIN AREAS IS 
MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOUNG COUPLES ON MODERATE INCOMES TO GET A HOME OF 
THEIR OWN. THE POPULATION BULGE AMONG THOSE IN THEIR LATE TEENS AND EARLY 
TWENTIES, AND THE WELCOME END TO HEAVY EMIGRATION, ALL ADD TO THE PRESSURE ON 
DEMAND AND PRICES.

61	WE WILL ENCOURAGE A SUSTAINABLE EXPANSION IN THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING TO MEET 
THIS DEMAND, IN A WAY WHICH DOES NOT PLACE UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE ENVIRONMENT OF 
OUR MAJOR CITIES, OR ERODE AMENITY AREAS.  

62	WE WILL EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL FOR SELECTIVE AND MODEST INCREASES IN 
HOUSING DENSITY ALONG PUBLIC TRANSPORT ROUTES AND IN CITY CENTRES. WE WILL GIVE 
FURTHER IMPETUS TO THE "LIVING OVER THE SHOP" INITIATIVE.

63	WE WILL ENSURE:
* ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSING AND FOR SOCIAL HOUSING
* THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTATE MANAGEMENT POLICIES TO ENSURE MORE EFFECTIVE 
ARRANGEMENTS AND MORE LOCAL PARTICIPATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITY HOUSING STOCK, ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED AREAS
* CONTINUATION OF AN ACTIVE REFURBISHMENT PROGRAMME FOR OLDER LOCAL AUTHORITY 
HOUSES.

64	A LARGE NUMBER OF LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSES ARE WITHOUT CENTRAL HEATING. WE 
INTEND TO ASK ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DRAW UP A FIVE-YEAR ENERGY PLAN PROVIDING 
FOR IMPROVED INSULATION AND VENTILATION AND FOR THE PROVISION OF FULL CENTRAL 
HEATING.

65	VARIOUS FUNDING METHODS WILL BE CONSIDERED, INCLUDING AN OFFSET AGAINST 
THE PRICE FOR TENANT PURCHASE, WHEN TENANTS HAVE FINANCED THE CENTRAL HEATING 
THEMSELVES.

HEALTH

66	WE ENDORSE THE HEALTH STRATEGY PUBLISHED IN 1994, AS A BASIS FOR THE 
PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR HEALTH SERVICES. EQUITY AND QUALITY IN SERVICE 
PROVISION AND EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES ARE CRUCIAL AIMS FOR US. LABOUR IS 
COMMITTED TO:
* CONTINUING TO DEVELOP CHILD CARE AND FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN OMBUDSMAN FOR CHILDREN AND A SOCIAL SERVICES INSPECTORATE.
* TACKLING HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS BY ENSURING THAT LEVELS OF INVESTMENT IN THIS 
INITIATIVE CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY, AND BY SETTING OUT MAXIMUM WAITING TIMES 
FOR DIFFERENT TREATMENTS.
* IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES EMBRACING A WIDE-RANGE OF ECONOMIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL 
SUPPORT SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES.
* ENSURING THAT VICTIMS OF HEPATITIS C ARE PROVIDED WITH A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH 
CARE PACKAGE AND SUPPORT SERVICES, AND THAT CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION ARE 
PROCESSED WITH SPEED AND SENSITIVITY.

* MAINTAINING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE BLOOD SUPPLY THROUGH IMPLEMENTING THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE FINLAY REPORT AND ANY OTHER NECESSARY MEASURES.
* PRIORITISATION IN FUNDING FOR SERVICES RELATING TO MENTAL HANDICAP, TO 
ELIMINATE WITHIN FIVE YEARS THE UNMET NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY THE NATIONAL 
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY DATABASE.
* PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TREATMENT FACILITIES FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM DRUGS 
MISUSE WITH INCREASED INVOLVEMENT OF GPS AND BETTER REHABILITATION AND SUPPORT 
SERVICES.
* EXTENDING GMS SERVICES AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO YOUNGER CHILDREN.
* INVESTMENT IN AND DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT OF "HEALTH GAIN" AND NECESSARY 
MONITORING OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS.

67	LABOUR WILL GIVE PRIORITY TO DEVELOPING SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY, TO 
DEVELOPING ACCESS TO SPECIALIST CANCER SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE REGIONS, AND TO 
SPONSORING MEASURES THAT WILL ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR 
OWN HEALTH.

DRUGS

68	LATER IN THIS MANIFESTO, WE DEAL WITH THE URGENCY OF TACKLING DRUG RELATED 
CRIME.  

69	WE SUPPORT THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SECOND REPORT OF THE MINISTERIAL 
TASK FORCE ON MEASURES TO REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR DRUGS.  WE NEED STRONG POLICIES 
AIMED AT BOTH SUPPLY REDUCTION AND DEMAND REDUCTION.  INCLUDED IN THE DEMAND 
REDUCTION POLICIES WILL BE PROPER AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FACILITIES. 

70	WE HAVE SPONSORED INCREASED ANTI-DRUGS EDUCATION, THROUGH SUBSTANCE ABUSE 
AWARENESS AND PREVENTION PROGRAMMES AND AN ANTI-HEROIN PROGRAMME, AND THE 
PROVISION FOR PARENTAL EDUCATION.

71	IN ADDITION, WE SUPPORT:
* A COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY INFORMATION AND SUPPORT NETWORK; THE WORK OF THE 
COMMUNITY DRUGS TEAMS IS CRITICAL IN THIS RESPECT.
* A CONTINUING GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED MEDIA CAMPAIGN TO DISPEL THE PERCEPTION THAT 
DRUGS CAN BE SAFELY USED RECREATIONALLY, WHICH IS AS UNCOMPROMISING AND AS 
EXPLICIT AS IS NECESSARY.
* FOSTERING THE ROLE OF ESTATE MANAGEMENT AS A COMMUNITY BASED RESPONSE TO THE 
DRUGS CRISIS, AND A REVERSAL OF VIGILANTE TYPE ACTIVITY.
* MORE SUPPORT FOR TRAINING IN COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP; THE TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT 
OF YOUTH LEADERS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES UNDER COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT AND 
SOCIAL ECONOMY MEASURES.
* A 24-HOUR STRONGLY ADVERTISED HELP LINE TO DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ABOUT DRUGS 
AND AVAILABLE SERVICES.

72	THE OVERALL AIM SHOULD BE TO HELP ADDICTS RETURN TO A DRUG-FREE LIFESTYLE  
-  THE MOST EFFECTIVE DRUG TREATMENT SERVICE WILL BE ONE WHICH OFFERS A BROAD 
RANGE OF OPTIONS TO ADDICTS ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS.  ADDICTS SHOULD BE OFFERED 
A CHOICE OF SERVICE - BE THAT METHADONE OR THERAPY -  UPON ENTERING INTO 
TREATMENT.  WHILE ONGOING METHADONE MAINTENANCE SHOULD CONTINUE WHERE NECESSARY, 
IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO OVER-RELY ON THAT FORM OF TREATMENT.

73	WE SUPPORT:
* THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY-BASED CLINICS, INCLUDING MOBILE UNITS, AS AN 
IMPORTANT PART OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO DRUG ABUSE.
* AN INCREASE IN DETOXIFICATION BEDS WITH BETTER FOLLOW-UP SERVICES.
* DIRECT FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR.
* INCREASED RESEARCH ON THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM: FOR EXAMPLE, SPECIALISATION 
ON ADDICTION STUDIES IN ONE OF THE MAJOR UNIVERSITIES.
* INCREASED FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM OF HEROIN SMOKING; HEROIN SMOKERS SHOULD HAVE 
ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE TREATMENT.

A SAFER 
PLACE
TO LIVE

LABOUR'S OVERALL APPROACH

1	WE WILL DEAL WITH THE CRIME PROBLEM IN A RESOLUTE AND DETERMINED FASHION. 
WE WANT TO PUT THE CRIMINAL OUT OF BUSINESS.  THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE FOR 
GANGSTERS AND DRUG BARONS  -  THAT IS BEHIND BARS.  

2	HOWEVER, OUR APPROACH TO CRIME IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY AIMED AT CONFRONTATION, 
BUT IS TARGETED ALSO, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, AT ITS ELIMINATION. WE HAVE TO TACKLE 
WITH EQUAL VIGOUR THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS WHICH GIVE RISE TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

3	IT IS CLEAR THAT THE DRUGS EPIDEMIC IS A WORLD-WIDE CRISIS. IT IS A 
PROBLEM WHICH AFFECTS EVERYONE. THE DRUGS PROBLEM HAS ITS ROOTS IN POVERTY, 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE. A 1994 HEALTH RESEARCH BOARD REPORT FOUND 
THAT OVER 80% OF THOSE BEING TREATED FOR HEROIN ADDICTION IN THE DUBLIN AREA 
WERE UNEMPLOYED; AND 92% WERE IN THE 15 TO 39 AGE BRACKET.

4	THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ORGANISED CRIME AND THE DRUGS TRADE IS A MAJOR 
THREAT NOT ONLY TO INDIVIDUALS, BUT ALSO TO THE PATTERN OF LIFE OF WHOLE 
COMMUNITIES. 

5	IN JULY 1996, THE LABOUR PARTY PUBLISHED A POLICY DOCUMENT "THE DRUGS 
MENACE AND ORGANISED CRIME". IT ARGUED THAT A SINGLE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL AGENCY 
WAS REQUIRED WITHOUT DELAY TO BREAK THE STRANGLEHOLD OF THE DRUG BARONS. THE 
CRIMINAL ASSETS BUREAU WAS ESTABLISHED BY RUAIRI QUINN IN THE SUMMER OF 1996. SO 
FAR, IT HAS HAD A NUMBER OF KEY SUCCESSES IN ITS EFFORTS TO PURSUE AND TO BRING 
TO JUSTICE THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE CRIMINAL DRUGS TRADE, AND THEIR ASSOCIATES 
AND PROFESSIONAL ADVISERS.

6	ACTION TO COMBAT CRIME, ESPECIALLY VIOLENT AND DRUG RELATED CRIME 
REQUIRES:
* SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RESOURCES 
* COORDINATED PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT ACROSS AGENCIES AND SERVICES, AND 
* COOPERATION AND SUPPORT FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

7	THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME INCLUDES THE STRAIGHTFORWARD TARGETS OF 
_ SEEKING TO PREVENT CRIME,
_ IMPROVED DETECTION AND ARREST RATES,
_ EFFICIENT AND FAIR PROCESSING OF TRIALS, AND
_ THE CORRECT BALANCE OF DETERRENCE, PUNISHMENT, AND REHABILITATION. 


8	THIS IN TURN INVOLVES
_ EFFECTIVE POLICING, 
_ REFORMS IN THE WAY OUR COURTS WORK, 
_ MORE PRISON PLACES AND 
_ GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE PROBATION SERVICE -  INCLUDING AN END TO UNSUPERVISED 
EARLY RELEASES FROM PRISON.  

9	THERE WILL ALWAYS BE HABITUAL CRIMINALS. PRISON, HOWEVER, IS NOT THE ONLY 
SOLUTION TO CRIME. PRISONS ARE FOR DETERRENCE, PUNISHMENT AND THE PROTECTION OF 
SOCIETY. ALL WEAPONS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME -  THE GARDAÌ, THE COURTS AND 
THE PRISONS -  REQUIRE AN IMPROVED MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEM. ADEQUATE 
FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES NEED TO BE PROVIDED FOR THE PROCESSING OF CRIMINAL 
CHARGES, AND  CRIMINAL TRIALS NEED TO BE ACCELERATED.

10	AT PRESENT, THE COST TO SOCIETY OF CONTAINING CRIME, IN TERMS OF EXCHEQUER 
SPENDING ON POLICING, PRISONS AND OTHER SERVICES IS MORE THAN £600M. PER ANNUM  
-  AND THE LOSS AND TRAUMA OF VICTIMS IS ALMOST UNMEASURABLE.

11	LABOUR BELIEVES IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MAJOR CHANGES IN A CRUCIAL SET OF 
RELATIONSHIPS, NAMELY THOSE BETWEEN THE GARDAÌ, THE PRISON SERVICE, THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE COURTS, AND THE PROBATION AND WELFARE SERVICE, 
SUBJECT TO OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE OIREACHTAS.

12	THERE IS AN EQUAL NEED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL, SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC MEASURES AIMED AT ENDING SOCIAL DEPRIVATION AND ALIENATION. 

13	THERE IS GREAT URGENCY IN TACKLING NOW THE CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE THE CRIME 
OF THE FUTURE. MOST CRIME IS COMMITTED BY YOUNG MEN FROM DEPRIVED BACKGROUNDS 
WHO HAVE LEFT SCHOOL EARLY. 
14	LABOUR BELIEVES THAT A SERIOUS CONCERTED EFFORT IS ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDE 
TARGETED PROGRAMMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AT RISK. 

15	AS WELL, THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ARE NOT TREATED WELL BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
SYSTEM. THIS MUST BE RECTIFIED.

CRIME PREVENTION

THE GARDAÌ

16	THE GARDAÌ ARE IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME. THEY ARE THE 
PRIMARY GUARDIANS OF THE COMMUNITY AND, AS SUCH, SHOULD BE AND BE SEEN TO BE, A 
PART OF THE COMMUNITY. THEY SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT IN THEIR STRUCTURES AND 
MANAGEMENT AND YET BE RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEEDS. GENUINE COMMUNITY POLICING 
IS NOT SIMPLY HAVING A GARDA ON THE BEAT. IT REQUIRES A FAR GREATER DEGREE OF 
INVOLVEMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SERVICES.

17	THE TYPE OF CRIME AND INDEED CRIMINAL WHICH THE GARDAÌ NOW HAVE TO DEAL 
WITH IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM FORMER TIMES -  MORE VIOLENT CRIME, EXTENSIVE DRUG 
TRAFFICKING AND AN INCREASE IN SOPHISTICATED WHITE COLLAR CRIME. THIS REQUIRES A 
MODERN MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, BETTER MORALE AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAREER 
PROGRESSION, NEW SKILLS IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY, AND TRAINING IN THE BEST WAYS 
OF CO-OPERATING EFFECTIVELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

18	CAREERS IN THE GARDA SÌOCH·NA SHOULD NORMALLY BE FULL-TIME AND FULLY 
PROFESSIONAL - BASED ON MUTUAL RESPECT BETWEEN CITIZENS AND MEMBERS OF THE FORCE 
WITH THE COMMON OBJECT OF SECURING A PEACEFUL AND SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE 
TO GET ON WITH THEIR DAILY LIVES. 


19	THERE IS A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ROLE ALSO FOR PART-TIME POLICING AT 
COMMUNITY LEVEL.

20	LABOUR BELIEVES THAT THERE SHOULD BE A WIDER DEBATE ON THE CHANGING ROLE 
OF THE GARDAÌ AND THAT THIS DEBATE SHOULD BE CONDUCTED IN A FORMAL CONTEXT.

WE PROPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMISSION ON POLICING TO HELP FORGE  A MODERN 
ROLE FOR THE POLICE FORCE. 

THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE FORMULATED ALONG THE LINES OF THE EDUCATION CONVENTION 
AND INVOLVE THE GARDAÌ THEMSELVES, THE CIVILIAN STAFF, COMMUNITY AND VOLUNTARY 
GROUPS, RESIDENTS GROUPS, APPROPRIATE EXPERTS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES.

ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE:
* 	THE MERITS OF ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT POLICE AUTHORITY 
* 	THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GARDAÌ, THE OIREACHTAS AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES
* 	INTERNAL GARDA MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES 
* 	THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE FORCE 
* 	THE APPROPRIATE FUNCTIONS FOR CIVILIAN STAFF, AND THE CONDITIONS WITHIN 
WHICH THEY WORK 
* 	THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE GARDAÌ AND OTHER AGENCIES SUCH AS CUSTOMS AND 
REVENUE 
* 	GARDA/COMMUNITY RELATIONS (INCLUDING THE ISSUE OF COMMUNITY POLICING) 
* 	THE ROLE OF SPECIALIST UNITS WITHIN THE GARDAÌ
* 	THE POTENTIAL FOR PART-TIME POLICING.


ACTIONS DIRECTED AT THE CAUSES OF CRIME

21	OTHER MEASURES IN THE MANIFESTO AIMED AT TACKLING DISADVANTAGE AND AT 
COUNTERING ALIENATION WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO A REDUCTION OF 
CRIME IN THE FUTURE.

22	IN THE SHORT-TERM, SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS IS VITAL.  
FOR EXAMPLE, YOUTH DIVERSION STRATEGIES ARE REQUIRED. THEY MUST BE TARGETED AT 
SPECIFIC HIGH DENSITY URBAN AREAS, WHERE THERE IS A COMBINATION OF A LARGE YOUNG 
POPULATION, HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND A LACK OF BASIC AMENITIES - THE AREAS FROM 
WHICH YOUNG OFFENDERS ARE MOST LIKELY TO COME.  

23	THE AIM SHOULD BE TO KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE WITHIN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR AS 
LONG AS POSSIBLE - BY MAKING THAT SYSTEM MORE RESPONSIVE TO THEIR NEEDS AND BY 
PROVIDING ALTERNATIVES TO THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION SERVICES. THIS WILL REQUIRE 
FURTHER INCREASES IN THE MONEY ALLOCATED TO PRE-PRIMARY AND PRIMARY EDUCATION.

24	THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GARDA DIVERSION PROGRAMME (FORMERLY THE NON STATUTORY  
JUVENILE LIAISON OFFICER SCHEME) IS TO DIVERT FIRST TIME, NON-SERIOUS CHILD 
OFFENDERS, WHERE FEASIBLE, FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY DRAWN INTO THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE PROGRAMME HAS BEEN JUDGED A SUCCESS BY THE GARDA 
AUTHORITIES, WITH UP TO 80% OF PARTICIPANTS EACH YEAR FAILING TO COME AGAIN TO 
THE ATTENTION OF THE GARDAÌ.  

25	THIS PROGRAMME SHOULD  BE:
_ PLACED ON A STATUTORY BASIS, TO ENHANCE ITS STATUS AND INCREASE ITS SUCCESS 
RATE,
_  EXTENDED TO INVOLVE PARENTS AND MEMBERS OF THE WIDER FAMILY AT A VERY EARLY 
STAGE FOLLOWING DETECTION OF OFFENDING BY A CHILD, AND
_ EXPANDED TO PROVIDE A FORUM FOR THE VICTIM OF CRIME, WHERE APPROPRIATE AND 
DESIRED, TO CONFRONT THE CHILD OFFENDER IN A PROPERLY CONTROLLED SETTING.

26	NOTWITHSTANDING THAT IT WAS SO STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY FIANNA F·IL WHEN IT 
HELD THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE YOUTH DIVERSION PROGRAMME MUST, OF COURSE, 
BE RECOGNISED AS A COMPLETE ANTITHESIS TO THE POLICY NOW BEING SO VEHEMENTLY 
TRUMPETED AS THEIR INSTANT SOLUTION TO THE MAJOR SCOURGE OF JUVENILE OFFENDING.

27	WE ADVOCATE:

* COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES IN DISADVANTAGED AREAS, SPECIALLY THOSE 
FAMILIES WHOSE NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET BY THE EDUCATION SYSTEM.
* COMMUNITY BASED HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL FACILITIES SIMILARLY TARGETED.
* EXPANSION OF THE EARLY START PROGRAMME. 
* STATE ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITY PLAYGROUPS WHICH MEET CERTAIN QUALITY CRITERIA.
* INCREASE IN REMEDIAL TEACHERS, EXPANSION OF BREAKING THE CYCLE, INCREASE IN 
HOME SCHOOL LIAISON OFFICERS.
* REVAMP THE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE SERVICE TO BECOME AN EDUCATION WELFARE SERVICE 
WHICH PROVIDES TRAINING/COUNSELLING AND SUPPORT SERVICE FOR CHILDREN WHO 
PERSISTENTLY AVOID SCHOOL AND FOR SCHOOL DROPOUTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOCAL 
PARTNERSHIPS OR OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITY SERVICES. THIS SERVICE WOULD ENGAGE IN 
SYSTEMATIC TRACING OF SCHOOL DROPOUTS AND PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE ACTIVITIES FOR 
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR WHOM THE STANDARD EDUCATION SERVICE IS NOT SUITABLE. 

* INITIALLY, CLUBS, RECREATION AREAS AND SPORTING ACTIVITIES COULD BE PROVIDED 
BEFORE GRADUALLY MOVING INTO MORE STRUCTURED EDUCATION/TRAINING FACILITIES.
* THE SERVICE COULD ALSO PROVIDE A COMMUNITY MENTORING PROGRAMME FOR EXCLUDED 
TEENAGERS. IT COULD ALSO TARGET ITS SERVICES AT THOSE STUDENTS WHO FIND THE 
TRANSITION FROM PRIMARY TO SECONDARY SCHOOLING IMPOSSIBLE OR VERY DIFFICULT.
* PRIMARY TEACHERS WHO MAY BE REDEPLOYED AS A RESULT OF THE FALL IN THE SCHOOL 
GOING POPULATION SHOULD NORMALLY BE USED IN A TARGETED WAY TO DEAL WITH 
DISADVANTAGE IN EDUCATION.
* THE HIGHER EDUCATION MAINTENANCE GRANTS WILL BE EXTENDED TO STUDENTS ATTENDING 
PLC COURSES.

DRUGS

28	THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS IS BOTH ESSENTIAL FOR THE OVERALL WELFARE OF 
SOCIETY AND A KEY COMPONENT IN THE TASK OF COMBATING AND PREVENTING CRIME.

29	THERE ARE THREE KEY ELEMENTS:
_ POLICIES AIMED AT SUPPLY REDUCTION
_ POLICIES AIMED AT DEMAND REDUCTION
_ PROPER TREATMENT FACILITIES

30	PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE OVER THE LAST YEAR IN THESE THREE AREAS. THE 
SUCCESSFUL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CRIMINAL ASSETS BUREAU, THE OPERATION OF LOCAL 
DRUGS TASK FORCES, AND THE INCREASED NUMBER OF PLACES FOR TREATING ADDICTS, HAVE 
ALL CONTRIBUTED. THE NATIONAL DRUGS STRATEGY TEAM WAS ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR TO 
CO-ORDINATE THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO THE DRUGS PROBLEM.

31	SCHOOL PROGRAMMES, THE PROVISION FOR PARENTAL EDUCATION, THE WORK OF 
COMMUNITY DRUGS TEAMS, AND TRAINING IN COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP IN ENHANCING THE 
ROLE OF ESTATE MANAGEMENT IN A COMMUNITY BASED RESPONSE TO DRUGS - ALL THESE ARE 
ESSENTIAL IN REDUCING DRUGS DEMAND.  OUR PROPOSALS FOR THE TREATMENT AND 
REHABILITATION OF ADDICTS ARE DEALT WITH IN PART 4 OF THIS DOCUMENT.

CRIME AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM

32	WE SUPPORT THE REFORM OF THE BAIL LAWS, AND THE REVAMPING OF THE COURTS 
SYSTEM THAT UNDERPINS THE APPROACH TO THE NEW COURTS SERVICE. WE BELIEVE THAT 
THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS WOULD FACILITATE FURTHER THE RAPID PROCESSING OF CRIMES 
THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

UNIFIED PROSECUTION SERVICE			

33	THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS AND THE CHIEF STATE SOLICITOR'S OFFICE 
BOTH HAVE A ROLE IN PROSECUTIONS AT PRESENT. WE PROPOSE THEIR COMBINATION INTO A 
UNIFIED PROSECUTION SERVICE. THIS WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT AND SPEED UP THE 
PREPARATION OF BOOKS OF EVIDENCE. THERE WOULD BE A SAVING IN GARDA TIME TAKEN UP 
IN PROSECUTIONS IN THE DISTRICT COURT. THE PROSECUTION SERVICE SHOULD HAVE 
DIRECT IT CONTACT WITH THE GARDAÌ. 

34	THE INITIAL FILES ON PROSECUTIONS COMPILED BY THE GARDAÌ ARE OFTEN 
INADEQUATE. THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY BETTER TRAINING FOR GARDAÌ IN THIS AREA 
AND BY HAVING SPECIALISTS IN EACH GARDA DIVISION WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF PROSECUTION 
REQUIREMENTS.

35	THE FORENSIC SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE SERVICE SHOULD BE IMPROVED AND, 
AGAIN, SHOULD BE IN DIRECT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONTACT.

PROSECUTION OF DRUGS-RELATED OFFENCES

36	THE PROSECUTION OF DRUGS-RELATED OFFENCES, AND ACTION RELATED TO 
EVICTIONS, SHOULD BE FAST-TRACKED BY GIVING THEM PRIORITY IN THE PROSECUTION 
SERVICE. THERE SHOULD BE DEADLINES FOR 
_ FORENSIC REPORTS,
_ DPP'S DIRECTIONS,
_ PREPARATIONS OF THE BOOK OF EVIDENCE AND
_ HEARINGS.
TRIALS WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF SERIOUS OFFENCE SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE PLACE WITHIN 60 
DAYS OF ARREST. THE NECESSARY SUPPORT SERVICES INCLUDING THE GARDA FORENSIC UNIT 
REQUIRE UPGRADING AS A MATTER OF URGENCY.

37	THE NEED FOR PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS OF ALL CHARGES IN THE DISTRICT 
COURT SHOULD BE RE-EXAMINED. SOME OFFENCES COULD BE DESIGNATED AS GOING STRAIGHT 
TO TRIAL.

INFORMATION

38	THE COURT SYSTEM SHOULD SHARE WITH THE GARDAÌ AND THE PRISONS AN EXTENSIVE 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FACILITY WHEREBY DETAILED INFORMATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE 
ON WARRANTS ISSUED, FAILURE TO TURN UP FOR TRIAL AND RELATED MATTERS. FOR 
EXAMPLE, WE DO NOT HAVE A REGISTER OF BENCH WARRANTS SO THERE IS NO EASY WAY OF 
FINDING OUT WHEN A WARRANT WAS ISSUED AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL, BY WHOM AND FOR 
WHAT.

CRIMINAL LEGAL AID

39	THE RULES ON ELIGIBILITY FOR CRIMINAL LEGAL AID SHOULD BE MORE RIGIDLY 
ENFORCED. A PUBLIC DEFENDER SYSTEM SHOULD BE TRIED ON A PILOT BASIS. THIS WOULD 
INVOLVE THE USE OF SALARIED LAWYERS, AT PUBLIC EXPENSE, TO REPRESENT PERSONS 
GRANTED LEGAL AID.
CRIMINAL LAW REFORM

40	IT IS NECESSARY, AND URGENT, TO SIMPLIFY AND CONSOLIDATE EXISTING LAW ON 
PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE IN THE COURTS AND ON SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW.  

41	ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE MADE TO CONTRACT OUT SOME OF THIS WORK TO DEAL WITH 
BACKLOGS.

42	ALTERNATIVE WAYS MUST BE FOUND TO DEAL WITH MINOR INFRINGEMENTS.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, INCREASED USE OF "ON THE SPOT FINES" IN RELATIVELY MINOR AREAS (SUCH AS 
BEING "FOUND ON" LICENSED PREMISES AFTER HOURS) WOULD FREE UP COURT TIME FOR 
DEALING WITH MORE SERIOUS OFFENCES. 

DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

43	THERE IS NEED FOR A WIDER RELATIONSHIP AND OPPORTUNITY FOR STRUCTURED 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE DPP AND THE OIREACHTAS. THIS WILL INVOLVE AMENDMENTS TO THE 
OVER 20 YEAR OLD ACT WHICH ESTABLISHED THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC 
PROSECUTIONS.

44	INDEPENDENCE MUST BE MAINTAINED, AND THE INTEGRITY OF PROSECUTION 
JUDGEMENTS ON INDIVIDUAL CASES PROTECTED. HOWEVER, THERE IS NEED FOR ELECTED 
REPRESENTATIVES TO BE ABLE TO QUERY NOT JUST MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION IN 
GENERAL TERMS, BUT ALSO FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO EXAMINE DPPS POLICIES 
* FOR PRIORITISATION OF CATEGORIES OF CASES, 
* HOW THE DPP SEES HIS ROLE IN THE WIDER CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND
*  THE RESOURCES AND LEVEL OF COORDINATION REQUIRED WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO 
ENSURE THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

PRISONS

45	LABOUR ACCEPTS THAT MORE PRISON PLACES ARE NEEDED. THE WHITTAKER REPORT 
SUGGESTED IN THE MID-EIGHTIES THAT IF CURRENT TRENDS CONTINUED, APPROXIMATELY 
4,000 PLACES WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THE MID-NINETIES. AT THE COMPLETION OF THE 
GOVERNMENT'S CURRENT BUILDING PROGRAMME, THE NUMBER OF PLACES AVAILABLE WILL BE 
IN THE REGION OF 3,250.

46	HOWEVER, WE ARE WARY OF ARGUMENTS SETTING OUT THE PROVISION OF MORE PRISON 
PLACES AS A PANACEA FOR OUR CRIME PROBLEM.

47	THERE SHOULD BE NO TOLERANCE OF DRUGS IN PRISONS GIVEN THE EXTENT OF DRUG 
ABUSE AND OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS.  LABOUR BELIEVES THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT 
THE RELEVANT HEALTH BOARD IN EACH CASE BE GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
DEVELOPING HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES WITHIN THE PRISONS. THE VEC FOR INSTANCE, IS 
ALREADY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROVISION OF EDUCATION.  

48	CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DISTRICT COURT 
WITHIN MOUNTJOY ITSELF. ATTENDANCE AT OUTSIDE COURTS CAN REPRESENT ANOTHER 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TRANSMITTING OF DRUGS TO PRISONERS.

49	THE CHOICE BETWEEN PRISON AND PAYMENT OF A FINE OUGHT NOT REST WITH THE 
CONVICTED PERSON; THE APPROPRIATE PENALTY SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE COURTS. 

50	IT IS WRONG THAT A PERSON MAY OPT TO AVOID A LARGE FINE BY SERVING A 
PRISON SENTENCE, OR THAT A PERSON MAY BE ABLE TO CHOOSE TO PAY THE FINE RATHER 
THAN SERVE A SENTENCE. WE ALREADY HAVE AN ATTACHMENT OF EARNINGS CAPACITY WITHIN 
OUR FAMILY LAW SYSTEM TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS. THIS FACILITY 
SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO ALL FINES LEVIED ON OFFENDERS.

51	NOR IS THERE ANY GOOD REASON WHY OFFENDERS, ASSESSED AS SUITABLE FOR 
TRANSFERS TO "OPEN" PRISONS, WHERE THEY WOULD ENJOY A HIGHER RATE OF REMISSION 
OF SENTENCE, CAN NONETHELESS REFUSE TO TAKE UP SUCH A TRANSFER IN THE KNOWLEDGE 
THAT, BY REMAINING IN MOUNTJOY, THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE RELEASED MUCH SOONER, FOR 
REASONS OF OVERCROWDING. OFFENDERS SHOULD SERVE OUT THEIR SENTENCES IN THE 
INSTITUTION TO WHICH THE AUTHORITIES WISH TO SEND THEM.

52	LABOUR SUPPORTS THE ESTABLISHMENT BY STATUTE OF AN INDEPENDENT PRISONS 
AGENCY, WITH THE FUNCTION OF MANAGING PRISONS COHERENTLY AND IN A PLANNED AND 
EFFECTIVE MANNER. IT WOULD HAVE AN INDEPENDENT BOARD APPOINTED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING BOTH MEMBERS WITH SPECIALIST EXPERTISE AND QUALIFICATIONS 
AND ALSO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMUNITY.

53	THE BOARD WOULD BE AUTONOMOUS IN ITS SUPERVISION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE 
AGENCY, WHICH WOULD BE ENTRUSTED TO A CHIEF EXECUTIVE WHO WOULD ALSO BE A BOARD 
MEMBER. THE BOARD WOULD APPOINT THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND HE OR SHE WOULD BE 
ACCOUNTING OFFICER OF THE AGENCY AND RESPONSIBLE TO THE BOARD FOR DAY-TO-DAY 
MANAGEMENT. THE BOARD WOULD REPORT ANNUALLY TO BOTH HOUSES OF THE OIREACHTAS. 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO APPEAR AND GIVE EVIDENCE ON A REGULAR 
BASIS TO RELEVANT D·IL COMMITTEE.

54	A NEW MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WOULD DEVOLVE GREATER AUTONOMY AND 
RESPONSIBILITY TO GOVERNORS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF, AND FUTURE PLANNING IN 
RELATION TO THEIR OWN INSTITUTIONS.

55	THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE WOULD RETAIN OVERALL POLICY MAKING FUNCTIONS, AND 
THE CENTRAL BUDGETARY ROLE. THERE WOULD BE A NEW LEGAL FRAMEWORK. 

56	CERTAIN POWERS WOULD BE RESERVED TO THE MINISTER - FOR EXAMPLE:
_ COMMUTATION / REMISSION OF PENALTIES,
_ TEMPORARY RELEASES,
_ TRANSFERS OF PRISONERS, AND  
_ POWERS TO ISSUE GENERAL POLICY DIRECTIVES, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE AGENCY, 
BUT WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH INDIVIDUAL CASES.

57	LABOUR ALSO SUPPORTS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR OF 
PRISONS, WITH SUFFICIENT POWERS TO INSPECT AND REPORT  BOTH ANNUALLY AND IN 
RELATION TO SPECIFIC INCIDENTS, ON CONDITIONS IN ALL PRISONS AND OTHER PLACES OF 
DETENTION, INCLUDING THOSE UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. 
SPECIFIC ISSUES OR COMPLAINTS COULD BE REFERRED TO THE INSPECTOR FOR 
INVESTIGATION EITHER BY THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE OR BY ANY MEMBER OF PRISON 
STAFF OR PRISONER. THE REPORTS OF THE INSPECTOR WOULD BE LAID BEFORE THE 
OIREACHTAS.

58	THE EXISTING ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH DEALS WITH THE RELEASE OF LONG-TERM 
PRISONERS SHOULD BE PLACED ON A STATUTORY BASIS AS A PAROLE BOARD. ITS REMIT 
SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO COVER A WIDER RANGE OF SENTENCES THAN IT AT PRESENT 
CONSIDERS.

59	 THE CRITERIA ACCORDING TO WHICH IT OPERATES SHOULD BE SET OUT IN THE 
LEGISLATION TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN ITS OPERATIONS. THE 
TEMPORARY RELEASE OF SHORT-TERM PRISONERS WOULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE PRISON 
AGENCY, WHICH WOULD OPERATE IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE PROBATION AND WELFARE 
SERVICE.

60	NEW PRISON LEGISLATION TO SET UP THE PRISON AGENCY WILL ALSO REPEAL AND 
CONSOLIDATE ALL EXISTING STATUTES MUCH OF WHICH DATES FROM THE 19TH CENTURY.  
THE ROLE AND STATUS OF VISITING COMMITTEES WILL BE UPGRADED IN THE LEGISLATION.
SENTENCING AND PROBATION

61	SENTENCING POLICY AND THE DESIRABLE DURATION OF SENTENCES NEED TO BE 
ADDRESSED. UNSUPERVISED EARLY RELEASES, WHICH ARE OFTEN DAMAGING TO BOTH THE 
COMMUNITY AND THE OFFENDER, SHOULD BE ENDED AS QUICKLY AS PRACTICAL. 

62	AT ANY ONE TIME, THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE ON EARLY RELEASE, WHO 
ARE UNSUPERVISED, AND WHO WERE NOT RELEASED FOR HUMANITARIAN OR REHABILITATION 
REASONS.

63	THE PROBATION SERVICE MUST AT PRESENT PROVIDE TWO QUITE SEPARATE SERVICES 
-  ONE FOR THE FAMILY COURTS HEARING CASES OF FAMILY BREAKDOWN AND ANOTHER FOR 
THE CRIMINAL COURTS, IN RELATION TO THE ASSESSMENT OF OFFENDERS. THE SERVICE IS 
UNDER INCREASING STRAIN, AND THE TWO SIDES OF THE SERVICE, WHICH MEET DIFFERENT 
NEEDS, SHOULD BE SEPARATED COMPLETELY. ON THE CRIMINAL SIDE, THE PROBATION 
SERVICE SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY TARGET FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE AREA OF 
SENTENCING.

64	THE LAW REFORM COMMISSION MADE EXTENSIVE RECOMMENDATIONS ON SENTENCING 
ISSUES. WE WILL ADDRESS THEM IN A NEW SENTENCING BILL.  WE ALSO SUPPORT THE VIEW 
THAT: 
* A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BY THE OIREACHTAS IN RELATION TO 
THE PRESENT RANGE OF SENTENCING OPTIONS WITH A VIEW TO BETTER COORDINATION OF 
PENAL AND SENTENCING POLICY.
* A STATUTORY SCHEME OF SENTENCING SHOULD NOT BE INTRODUCED, BUT RATHER NON-
STATUTORY GUIDELINES TO THE EFFECT THAT THE SEVERITY OF THE SENTENCE TO BE 
IMPOSED SHOULD BE MEASURED IN PROPORTION TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENDING 
BEHAVIOUR.

* A SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A SANCTION OF LAST RESORT.
* COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE.
* A CENTRALLY LOCATED CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATABASE SHOULD BE CREATED FOR THE 
COMPILATION AND DISSEMINATION OF STATISTICS RELEVANT TO SENTENCING.

65	IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS THAT WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT MANDATORY AND 
MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR INDICTABLE OFFICES SHOULD BE INTRODUCED. HOWEVER, LABOUR 
BELIEVES THAT THE MANDATORY SENTENCE FOR MURDER SHOULD BE RETAINED. 

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN

66	VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IS A SERIOUS AND WIDESPREAD PROBLEM, WITH 7% OF 
WOMEN CURRENTLY SUFFERING ABUSE FROM THEIR PARTNER. WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. 

67	WE WILL ENSURE THAT 
* THERE IS A PROPER NETWORK OF SERVICES FOR WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN. 
* TREATMENT PROGRAMMES FOR MEN, WHICH CONFRONT THE ROOT CAUSES OF ABUSE, ARE PUT 
IN PLACE. 
* THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL TREAT A VIOLENT ASSAULT ON A WOMAN BY SOMEONE SHE 
KNOWS AS SERIOUSLY AS A VIOLENT ATTACK ON HER FROM A STRANGER.

VICTIMS OF CRIME

68	OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM RIGHTLY PROVIDES FOR LEGALLY IMPOSED SANCTIONS 
AGAINST OFFENDERS. BUT WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS GIVEN DUE REGARD TO THE RIGHTS OF THE 
VICTIMS -  IN PARTICULAR TO THEIR RIGHT TO INFORMATION ON THE PROGRESS OF THE 
INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION. 

69	A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SHOULD BE INTRODUCED FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING 
VICTIMS INFORMED. RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF 
THE GARDA INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF CRIME TO LIAISE WITH AND GIVE 
INFORMATION TO VICTIMS AS TO THE STAGE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS WHICH THE 
CASE HAS REACHED.	 

70	THE WORK OF THE IRISH ASSOCIATION FOR VICTIM SUPPORT IS FULLY RECOGNISED. 
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ITS ACTIVITIES WILL BE ALLOCATED. A COURT ACCOMPANIMENT 
SERVICE TO PROVIDE ASSURANCE AND INFORMATION FOR VICTIMS FACING UNFAMILIAR AND 
INTIMIDATING COURT SURROUNDINGS WILL BE INTRODUCED ON A PILOT BASIS.

71	THERE CAN BE SEVERE DIFFICULTY AND WORRIES FOR VICTIMS WHO ARE WITNESSES 
IN SERIOUS CASES WHEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE UNFAMILIAR AND POTENTIALLY 
HOSTILE FRAMEWORK OF COURTS AND COURT PROCEEDINGS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE NEXT 
GOVERNMENT CAREFULLY EXAMINES THE ISSUE OF ENSURING VICTIMS RIGHTS TO LEGAL 
ADVICE OR REPRESENTATION IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS.

CONCLUSION

72	CRIME DIVIDES SOCIETIES.  IT DAMAGES THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THOSE WHO FEEL 
THREATENED BY IT AND CAN OFTEN MAKE THEM RETREAT FROM THE WIDER COMMUNITIES IN 
WHICH THEY LIVE.

73	WE CAN NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE DANGERS CRIME POSES TO OUR SOCIAL FABRIC 
AND WE ARE DETERMINED TO TACKLE IT.  TO BE EFFECTIVE, WE REQUIRE A TWO PRONGED 
APPROACH.  WE NEED TO DEAL WITH EXISTING CRIME IN A TOUGH AND DETERMINED 
FASHION.  BUT, JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, WE NEED TO TACKLE NOW THE CONDITIONS THAT 
CAUSE THE CRIME OF THE FUTURE.

74	IN SHORT, WE HAVE TO BE SINGLE-MINDED ABOUT CRIME - AND JUST AS SINGLE-
MINDED ABOUT ITS CAUSES.	

A BETTER PLACE
 TO LIVE AND WORK

INTRODUCTION

1	IRELAND IS EXPERIENCING A VIBRANT PERIOD OF VERY STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH 
AND DEVELOPMENT. ALL THE REAL INDICATORS TELL THE SAME STORY:
_ THE SURGE IN EMPLOYMENT, 
_ RISING LIVING STANDARDS, 
_ FAST GROWTH IN GNP, 
_ MORE IRISH PEOPLE COMING BACK TO LIVE AND WORK HERE, 
_ MORE NEW HOUSES BUILT,
_ RISING NUMBERS OF FOREIGN HOLIDAYS, 
_ INVESTMENT BY HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES,
_ RISING NUMBERS ENTERING THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION AND 
_ OTHER VERY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS.

2	THIS TYPE OF PROGRESS IS NECESSARY AND WELCOME. HOWEVER, IT MEANS THAT WE 
SHOULD PAY EVER INCREASING ATTENTION TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE, TO THE TYPE OF 
ENVIRONMENT THAT IS EVOLVING, AND TO THE INCLUSION OF ALL CITIZENS AND 
COMMUNITIES IN  SUSTAINABLE AND BALANCED DEVELOPMENT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
3	GNP GROWTH IN AGGREGATE IS OF LITTLE BENEFIT IF SOMEONE DOES NOT HAVE THE 
INCOME, OR THE PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT TO ENJOY ITS FRUITS.

4	TO ACHIEVE THIS,  THE RIGHT MIX OF  POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AND COMMUNITY 
INVOLVEMENT IS VITAL. 

5	FOR EXAMPLE, IMPROVING THE WAY TRANSPORT IS MANAGED, DEALING WITH TRAFFIC 
CONGESTION, ENSURING BETTER QUALITY OF AIR AND WATER, ENHANCING FOOD SAFETY, 
SENSIBLE WASTE MANAGEMENT, PROTECTION OF THE COUNTRY'S NATIONAL HERITAGE AND 
AMENITIES AND BALANCED REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT  - ALL OF THESE HAVE TO BE 
PRIORITIES.

6	AND THERE ARE DRAMATIC OPPORTUNITIES IN FRONT OF US TO CREATE A BETTER 
FRAMEWORK FOR ARTISTIC DEVELOPMENT, TO ENCOURAGE WIDER PARTICIPATION IN SPORT, 
TO SHARE OUR HERITAGE AND OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT WITH VISITORS FROM ABROAD, TO 
RENEW OUR OWN CULTURE IN NEW, EXCITING WAYS.

7	A HIGH QUALITY ENVIRONMENT HAS LONG BEEN PART OF IRELAND'S NATIONAL 
ENDOWMENT. INDEED, THE COUNTRY'S GREEN IMAGE HAS ALREADY GIVEN US A COMPETITIVE 
ADVANTAGE IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, FOOD AND TOURISM BEING NOTABLE EXAMPLES. 
CHANGING SETTLEMENT, SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND LIFESTYLE PATTERNS, HOWEVER, HAVE 
ALTERED THE BALANCE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY IN IRELAND.
8	THE THREAT TO OUR ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN GROWING AND THE SYMPTOMS OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS ARE BECOMING APPARENT: INCREASING WATER POLLUTION, 
DEPLETION OF NATURAL RESOURCES, WASTE PRODUCTION, DAMAGE TO NATURAL HABITATS AND 
EROSION OF OUR LANDSCAPES ARE ALL SYMPTOMATIC OF THIS TREND.

9	IT IS NOW TIME TO ESTABLISH A SOUNDER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IRELAND'S 
ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENT. IF THIS CAN BE DONE SUCCESSFULLY THEN THE STRONG GROWTH 
WE NOW ENJOY AND SEEK TO MAINTAIN WILL BE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE.

10	 THE FUNDAMENTALS MUST BE RIGHT. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT DEMANDS A NEW WAY 
OF LIVING AND DOING BUSINESS, A NEW DESIGN OF POLICIES TO GUIDE FUTURE ACTION, 
AND TO GIVE REALITY TO A NEW VISION FOR IRELAND.

PHYSICAL PLANNING

11	THE LABOUR PARTY HAS AN UNEQUALLED RECORD IN STANDING UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF 
LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE FACE OF UNJUSTIFIED REZONING AND BAD PLANNING.

12	WE BELIEVE THE KEY TO PROPER PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT IS THE DEVELOPMENT 
PLAN. HOWEVER, WE RECOGNISE THAT THE PRESENT DEVELOPMENT PLAN PROCESS HAS A 
NUMBER OF MAJOR DEFICIENCIES. MANY PLANS TEND TO BE STATIC, CONTROL-ORIENTATED 
DOCUMENTS RATHER THAN BLUEPRINTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITIES. 

13	OFTEN, MAJOR CONCERNS SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT OR PROVISION OF 
HEALTH OR EDUCATION SERVICES ARE SIMPLY NOT DEALT WITH. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN 
THE PROCESS OF DRAWING UP AND ADOPTING DEVELOPMENT PLANS TENDS TO BE RIGID AND 
"TOP-DOWN".

14	LABOUR IN GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS:

* A NATIONAL CONVENTION ON PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT WILL BE HELD IN ORDER TO 
REACH A BROAD CONSENSUS ABOUT PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
* WE WILL SEEK TO PLACE BEFORE THE CONVENTION A NEW PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 
BILL, TO INTRODUCE A NEW HIERARCHY OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS, NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND 
LOCAL.

15	WE WILL BE RECOMMENDING THE FOLLOWING FRAMEWORK:

NATIONAL

16	THE NATIONAL PLAN WILL INTEGRATE PHYSICAL PLANNING WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS ROADS AND RAIL. 

17	THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FORUM, FOLLOWING A PROCESS OF 
CONSULTATION AND RESEARCH, WILL BE ASKED TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO GOVERNMENT 
REGARDING GROWTH CENTRES FOR THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. 

18	THE ISSUE OF THE FURTHER GROWTH OF DUBLIN, TOGETHER WITH THE DIFFICULTY IN 
MAINTAINING POPULATION LEVELS IN RURAL IRELAND, WILL BE ADDRESSED.

19	THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE ASSESSED BY GOVERNMENT AS THE BASIS FOR A 
NATIONAL  DEVELOPMENT PLAN.

REGIONAL

20	REGIONAL PLANS WILL BE DRAWN UP BY THE REGIONAL AUTHORITIES IN 
CONSULTATION WITH COMMUNITY COUNCILS, ROADS AUTHORITIES, CIE AND ITS CONSTITUENT 
COMPANIES, 

TELECOM, IBEC, TRADE UNIONS, HEALTH BOARDS, REGIONAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES AND 
VEC'S AND OTHER RELEVANT INTERESTS. 

21	THE PLANS WILL TAKE ACCOUNT OF LAND USE POLICY, TRANSPORT PLANNING, 
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, HOUSING NEEDS AND POPULATION GROWTH, TOURISM, FORESTRY 
AND AGRICULTURE. THE PLANS MUST HAVE REGARD TO NATIONAL GROWTH CENTRE POLICY.

LOCAL

22	LOCAL PLANS WILL TAKE ACCOUNT OF LOCAL LAND USE CONSIDERATIONS, AND 
INCORPORATE PROPER PLANNING AND PROVISION OF SERVICES - INCLUDING HEALTH, 
EDUCATION, SOCIAL SERVICES, LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES, SHOPPING AND RECREATIONAL 
FACILITIES.

23	PLANS AT ALL THREE LEVELS WILL INCORPORATE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
CONSIDERATIONS.

24	A NEW PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCEDURE FOR LOCAL PLANS WILL BE DEVISED WHICH 
WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
_ SHARING OF INFORMATION PAPERS DRAFTED IN NON-TECHNICAL LANGUAGE WITH COMMUNITY 
AND OTHER INTEREST GROUPS.
_ MANDATORY CONSULTATION WITH ALL RELEVANT INTEREST GROUPS INCLUDING RESIDENTS 
ASSOCIATIONS, CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE, HEALTH AGENCIES, REGIONAL EDUCATION BOARDS 
ETC.
_ DRAFT PLANS TO PROVIDE OPTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES FOR DISCUSSION.
_ ALL DOCUMENTATION TO BE PROVIDED WITH A NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY INCLUDING THE 
FINAL ADOPTED PLAN.
_ ORAL HEARINGS TO BE CHAIRED BY AN INDEPENDENT PERSON BEFORE FINAL ADOPTION OF 
PLAN.
_ ALL MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOR EXAMPLE BY THE ESB, GAS, TELEPHONES 
AND ROADS MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
25	IN THE REFORMED PROCESS, AN BORD PLEAN·LA WILL BE BOUND BY DEVELOPMENT 
PLANS IN DETERMINING PLANNING APPEALS.

26	IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO ADOPT AREA PLANS UNTIL THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT 
PLAN HAS BEEN ADOPTED.

27	PARTNERSHIP 2000 POINTS TO THE NEED TO CONSIDER FURTHER STREAMLINING OF 
THE PLANNING SYSTEM TO MINIMISE DELAYS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND THE INTRODUCTION 
OF ACCELERATED PROCEDURES FOR MAJOR PROJECTS INVOLVING SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYMENT 
AND ADDED VALUE. THESE PROCEDURES WILL ALLOW FOR APPLICATIONS FOR OUTLINE 
PLANNING PERMISSION TO BE MADE ON SITES EARMARKED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
LIGHT/CLEAN INDUSTRY. 

28	CONDITIONS WILL INCLUDE SPECIFIED CLASSES OF INDUSTRY, OUTLINE DESIGNS OF 
STRUCTURES AND MAXIMUM EMISSION STANDARDS. HEAVY INDUSTRY INCLUDING CHEMICAL/ 
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WILL 
NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE SPECIFIED LIST OF ACCEPTABLE INDUSTRIES.

29	THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF PLANNING AND LICENSING OF 
ACTIVITIES WHICH HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH PHYSICAL PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY INTEGRATED TO ALLOW FOR A HOLISTIC CONSIDERATION 
OF COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS. THE PLANNING SYSTEM AND THE LICENSING SYSTEM 
OF THE EPA WILL BE REVISED TO MAKE IT MANDATORY THAT BOTH APPLICATIONS ARE 
CONSIDERED SIMULTANEOUSLY. 

30	FURTHERMORE, BOTH THE PLANNING AUTHORITY AND THE EPA WILL BE OBLIGED TO 
CONSULT WITH EACH OTHER AS APPLICATIONS ARE CONSIDERED. 


31	APPLICATIONS RELATING TO FIRE AND BUILDING CONTROL WILL ALSO BE 
SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSIDERED. BORD PLEAN·LA WILL BE GIVEN THE POWER TO TAKE 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS INTO ACCOUNT IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN 
DETERMINING ON A PLANNING APPEAL AND HAVE REGARD TO STANDARDS IMPOSED BY THE 
EPA.

32	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES WILL BE CHANGED TO ENSURE THE 
INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS.

33	FOR PLANNING APPLICATIONS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, IF AN ENVIRONMENT IMPACT 
STATEMENT IS REQUIRED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPER WILL CHOOSE FROM A LIST OF 
CONSULTANTS PROVIDED BY THE PLANNING AUTHORITY. THE CONSULTANT WILL BE 
CONTRACTED BY THE PLANNING AUTHORITY TO CARRY OUT THE EIS AND THE COST WILL BE 
RECOVERED THROUGH PLANNING FEES. PUBLIC CONSULTATION AT THE SCOPING STAGE OF THE 
STUDY WILL BE MANDATORY.

34	IN THE CASE OF DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING THE STATE, CONSIDERATION WILL BE 
GIVEN TO ADOPTING AN INDEPENDENT PROCESS TO CERTIFY EIA STATEMENTS. ALL MAJOR 
PUBLIC PROJECTS INVOLVING AN EIS WILL BE OBLIGED TO INVOLVE THE PUBLIC IN THE 
SCOPING PROCESS, AND BEFORE BEING CERTIFIED, AN ORAL HEARING WILL BE REQUIRED.

35	INFORMATION ON PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT WILL BE MADE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO 
LOCAL COMMUNITIES. LIBRARIES, POST OFFICES, AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRES WILL BE 
MORE WIDELY USED FOR PUBLIC NOTICE PROCEDURES, PARTICULARLY PLANNING 
APPLICATIONS AND PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCESSES.

36	LOCAL AUTHORITY PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCEDURES WILL BE REVISED AND 
IMPROVED TO ENSURE THE MAXIMUM LEVEL OF GENUINE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN 
DECISION-MAKING.


37	THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND OTHER FORMS OF SPECIAL 
DESIGNATION, E.G. NATIONAL HERITAGE AREAS (NHAS), SPECIAL PROTECTION AREAS 
(SPAS) WILL BE CLARIFIED IN THE FORTHCOMING BILL TO AMEND THE WILDLIFE ACT.  WE 
WILL EXAMINE MEANS OF WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO FUND A 
THREATENED SPECIES RECOVERY PROGRAMME.

38	 THE RANGE OF DEVELOPMENT CURRENTLY CLASSED AS EXEMPTED UNDER THE PLANNING 
CODE WILL BE REVIEWED.

39	NEW LEGISLATION IS BEING PREPARED ALONG THE LINES RECOMMENDED IN 
STRENGTHENING THE PROTECTION OF THE ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE (PUBLISHED IN 
SEPTEMBER 1996), AND A PACKAGE OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MEASURES WILL 
CREATE A FULLY EFFECTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING THE BUILT HERITAGE. OWNER 
OCCUPIERS OF LISTED BUILDINGS WHO WISH TO CARRY OUT RESTORATION WORKS WILL BE 
SUPPORTED.

SELLAFIELD

40	FOLLOWING THE SUCCESS OF THE "NIREX CAMPAIGN" TWO AREAS IN THE BRITISH 
NUCLEAR FUELS OPERATION ARE OF VERY SERIOUS CONCERN TO IRELAND:

* THE FIRST IS THE OLD MAGNOX REACTORS. THEY MUST BE DECOMMISSIONED WITHOUT 
FURTHER DELAY AND REGARDLESS OF COST. THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING SAFETY CASE FOR 
THE DECOMMISSIONING. 
* THE SECOND MAJOR THREAT TO IRELAND COMES FROM THE STORAGE OF HIGHLY ACTIVE 
LIQUID WASTE IN TANKS AT THE SELLAFIELD COMPLEX. 

41	WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THE NIREX DUMP AND WILL NOW 
PURSUE THESE TWO PRIMARY TARGETS.

TRANSPORT

INTRODUCTION

42	TRANSPORT POLICY SHOULD INVOLVE SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT AND CLEAR 
STRATEGIES. THE EMPHASIS MUST BE ON OPTIMUM USE OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
RESOURCES, REFLECTING THE REQUIREMENT TO MOVE PEOPLE AND GOODS, NOT VEHICLES. 

43	THE TRANSPORT SYSTEM SHOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT AND COMPETITIVE, SAFE, 
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND CUSTOMER ORIENTED. TRANSPORT POLICY SHOULD BE 
DEMAND DRIVEN: IT SHOULD REINFORCE LAND USE, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES.  

RURAL TRANSPORT

44	IN THE CONTEXT OF RURAL DISADVANTAGE THE PROVISION OF LOCAL PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT SERVICES IS ONE OF THE KEYS TO BREAKING THE ISOLATION AND ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE OF THOSE LIVING IN RURAL AREAS. THIS INCLUDES YOUNGER PEOPLE 
WISHING TO GO TO WORK OR COLLEGE OR OLDER CITIZENS TO SHOP, SOCIALISE, OR TRAVEL 
LOCALLY.

45	LABOUR PROPOSES TO INTRODUCE A LICENSING REGIME THAT WILL GIVE AN 
INCENTIVE TO TRANSPORT OPERATORS (PUBLIC AND PRIVATE), TO PROVIDE WIDE-SPREAD 
SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS. 

46	THIS WILL BE ENHANCED BY A SYSTEM OF CONTRACTING AND THE FREE TRAVEL 
ARRANGEMENT.

47	LABOUR SUPPORTS, IN LINE WITH THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
STRATEGY, EFFICIENT, COST-EFFECTIVE AND CUSTOMER FOCUSED DEVELOPMENT OF THE RAIL 
NETWORK. THIS WILL PROVIDE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGIONAL 
BENEFITS.
URBAN TRANSPORT

48	IT IS OUR INTENTION TO INTENSIFY THE EVOLUTION OF POLICY AS FOLLOWS:
_ IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DUBLIN TRANSPORTATION INITIATIVE WILL BE INTENSIFIED.
_ ALL THREE LIGHT RAIL LINES IN DUBLIN WILL BE COMPLETED, EXTENSIONS TO THE DART 
BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH WILL PROCEED AS QUICKLY AS PRACTICAL.
_ FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARROW LINE RAILWAY COMMUTER SERVICES FOR WEST 
DUBLIN AND KILDARE WILL BE A PRIORITY.
_ QUALITY BUS CORRIDORS IN DUBLIN WILL BE EXTENDED AND FURTHER SUPPORTED.
_ OPERATION FREEFLOW IN DUBLIN WILL BE MAINTAINED AND ADEQUATELY RESOURCED IN TO 
THE FUTURE.
_ A NATIONAL CYCLING ADVISORY GROUP WILL BE SET UP TO RECOMMEND OPTIONS FOR THE 
PROVISION OF A NATIONAL NETWORK OF CYCLE PATHS. THE GROUP WILL BE MADE UP OF 
REPRESENTATIVES OF BORD F·ILTE, LOCAL AUTHORITIES, CYCLING ORGANISATIONS ETC.
_ URBAN AUTHORITIES AND IN DUBLIN THE DUBLIN TRANSPORT OFFICE WILL WORK WITH 
LOCAL COMMUNITIES, BUSINESS AND SCHOOLS TO EXTEND AND IMPROVE SAFE CYCLE ROUTES 
TO WORK AND SCHOOL.
_ LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE SUPPORTED IN REDUCING OR BANNING DELIVERIES AND 
REFUSE COLLECTION IN COMMERCIAL AREAS DURING BUSINESS HOURS.
_ THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND APPROPRIATE AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE DUBLIN 
TRANSPORTATION OFFICE, WILL ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE GREATER PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE 
UNSUSTAINABLE ASPECTS OF INCREASING USE OF VEHICLE TRANSPORT.

ROADS

49	DEVELOPMENT WILL CONTINUE ON THE FOUR STRATEGIC ROAD CORRIDORS LINKING THE 
PRINCIPAL CENTRES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POPULATION, PORTS AND AIRPORTS. 
THE COMPLETION OF THE NATIONAL PRIMARY ROAD NETWORK WILL BE SPEEDED UP. ADEQUATE 
RESOURCES WILL BE ALLOCATED TO NATIONAL SECONDARY ROADS.

50	THE ROADS RESTORATION PROGRAMME FOR COUNTY ROADS WILL BE RESOURCED AT THE 
PRESENT HIGH LEVEL INTO THE FUTURE UNTIL THE NETWORK IS UP TO STANDARD. UNDER 
LABOUR OUR COUNTY ROADS WILL BE MAINTAINED AND NEVER AGAIN WILL RURAL 
COMMUNITIES BE CUT OFF BECAUSE OF POORLY MAINTAINED ROADS.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

51	THE STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  WAS LAUNCHED BY BRENDAN HOWLIN 
IN APRIL 1997. THE STRATEGY SETS OUT THE PROGRAMME OF COMMITMENTS AND ACTIONS 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE ECONOMIC SPECTRUM WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO FOCUS OUR ECONOMY AND 
OUR SOCIETY ON A MORE SUSTAINABLE PATH. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LABOUR'S 
PROPOSALS ON THE ENVIRONMENT IS INFORMED BY THE STRATEGY WHICH HAS BEEN BROADLY 
WELCOMED AS A MAJOR MILESTONE IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IN IRELAND.

ACTION AND AWARENESS

52	PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT, AND UNSUSTAINABLE PRACTICES WHICH 
THREATEN OR DAMAGE IT, IS WELL DEVELOPED. HOWEVER, THIS CONCERN DOES NOT ALWAYS 
TRANSLATE INTO ACTION AT INDIVIDUAL OR CONSUMER LEVEL. INDIVIDUAL ACTION COUNTS. 
THE STRATEGY WILL ENSURE THAT PEOPLE MAKE CHOICES ON THE BASIS OF BETTER 
INFORMATION.

53	LABOUR IN GOVERNMENT WILL ASK THE DIRECTOR OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO MAKE 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROVIDING FULL AND AUTHORITATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION 
TO CONSUMERS, AND IN CONSULTATION WITH THE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS, TO PREPARE A 
CODE OF PRACTICE ON GREEN MARKETING.

54	THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN THE ENVIRONMENT REGULATIONS 1996, WILL BE 
REVIEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION. A CODE OF GOOD 
PRACTICE ON ISSUING ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION WILL BE PREPARED FOR IMPLEMENTING 
AUTHORITIES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

55	THE NEW LITTER POLLUTION BILL WILL BE VIGOROUSLY IMPLEMENTED, THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE - ENFO - WILL BE FURTHER DEVELOPED AND GREATER EMPHASIS 
WILL BE PLACED ON ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION WITHIN THE FORMAL EDUCATION SYSTEM.

56	A NEW SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF 
THE ENVIRONMENT FOR COMMUNITY BASED ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS ACTIVITIES.

57	AS PART OF THE CONTINUING IMPLEMENTATION OF A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
STRATEGY, WE  INTEND TO ACT ACROSS THE FOLLOWING AREAS:

WATER RESOURCES

* AN INTEGRATED CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE WILL REVERSE DETERIORATING 
QUALITY TRENDS IN SELECTED CATCHMENTS.

* NEW REGULATIONS WILL BE MADE UNDER THE WASTE MANAGEMENT ACT 1996, TO PREVENT 
AND CONTROL WATER POLLUTION FROM WASTE DISPOSAL.

* NEW WATER QUALITY STANDARDS WILL GUIDE EPA AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN DEVISING 
AND IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH NON-POINT POLLUTION.

* THE FISHERIES (AMENDMENT) BILL WILL BE ENACTED TO PROVIDE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF THE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.

* A NATIONAL GROUND-WATER PROGRAMME WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO QUANTIFY RESOURCES, 
ESTABLISH QUALITY AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE USE.

* A NATIONAL COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT POLICY WILL BE DEVELOPED.

* CONTINUING INVESTMENT TO MEET WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS WILL BE 
A FEATURE OF POLICY.

* A WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAMME IS BEING DEVELOPED AT CENTRAL AND LOCAL LEVEL 
INCLUDING "WATER AUDITS" FOR CAPITAL SCHEMES, FUNDING FOR WATER CONSERVATION 
PROJECTS AND A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO LEAKAGE CONTROL.

* PRICING POLICIES WILL BE DEVELOPED TO PROMOTE CONSERVATION BY MAJOR INDUSTRIAL 
AND COMMERCIAL WATER USERS.

LANDSCAPE AND NATURE

* THE WILDLIFE ACT WILL BE UPDATED TO PROVIDE A STATUTORY BASIS FOR NATURAL 
HERITAGE AREAS. A NEW BILL WILL ENSURE STATUTORY RECOGNITION FOR NATIONAL 
GARDENS AND HISTORIC PARKS.

* THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES (NATURAL HABITATS) REGULATIONS 1997, WILL SUPPORT THE 
DEFINITION AND PROTECTION OF SOME 400 PROPOSED SPECIAL AREAS OF CONSERVATION, 
COVERING 550,000 HECTARES OR SOME 5% OF LAND AREA.
* LABOUR IS ALSO COMMITTED TO THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A LIFFEY VALLEY 
NATIONAL PARK.

WASTE MANAGEMENT

* NEW REGULATIONS ON WASTE WILL INCLUDE THE EPA LICENSING OF LANDFILL SITES, 
COMMENCING ON 1 MAY 1997 AND MANAGEMENT OF PACKAGING WASTES.

* WASTE MANAGEMENT POLICIES WILL AIM TO  ACHIEVE:
_ THE STABILISATION OF MUNICIPAL WASTE QUANTITIES BY 1999, AND THEIR REDUCTION 
BY 20% BY 2010
_ THE DIVERSION OF 20% OF MUNICIPAL WASTE FROM LANDFILL, BY RECYCLING, BY 1999, 
WITH HIGHER TARGETS TO BE ESTABLISHED FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS
_ AN INCREASE TO AT LEAST 50% IN THE RECOVERY RATE FOR PACKAGING WASTE BY 2005.

* THERE WILL BE A CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMPILATION OF WASTE STATISTICS 
TO PROVIDE A YARDSTICK FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

* THE USE OF ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS WILL BE EXPLORED TO REDUCE WASTE, PROMOTE 
REUSE/RECYCLING AND INCREASE MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY.

AIR QUALITY

* POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL AIR QUALITY IS MAINTAINED AND IMPROVED, 
PARTICULARLY IN URBAN AREAS, WILL BE ACTIVELY PURSUED.

* EPA WILL BE ASKED TO PREPARE A NATIONAL AIR QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAMME.


ENERGY

* ENERGY CONSERVATION AND DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT TO PROMOTE EFFICIENCY WILL BE 
ENCOURAGED AND MONITORED. 

* NEW INCENTIVES WILL BE INTRODUCED TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN RENEWABLE ENERGY 
SOURCES.

* UNDER THE RENEWABLE ENERGY STRATEGY, INSTALLED ELECTRICITY GENERATING CAPACITY 
FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES WILL REACH 10% OF TOTAL INSTALLED CAPACITY BY THE END OF 
1999; FURTHER GROWTH UNDER THE STRATEGY WILL INCREASE THIS TO 14% BY 2010.

* THE NATIONAL OBJECTIVE IS TO LIMIT THE GROWTH IN TOTAL EMISSIONS OF THE MAJOR 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS UP TO THE YEAR 2010 TO 15% ABOVE 1990 LEVELS.

* STRONG POLICIES WILL BE MAINTAINED AND INTENSIFIED, AS APPROPRIATE, TO 
MINIMISE AND ELIMINATE THE THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND THE 
ENVIRONMENT, POSED BY THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY.

AGRICULTURE

* MEASURES WILL INCLUDE THE USE OF REVISED RECOMMENDED APPLICATION RATES FOR 
PHOSPHORUS (P) FERTILISERS FOR GRASSLAND, TO REDUCE SOIL P LEVELS. THE AIM WILL 
BE TO SECURE A REDUCTION OF 10% PER ANNUM IN ARTIFICIAL P FERTILISER USAGE OVER 
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

* INTEGRATED POLLUTION CONTROL (IPC) LICENSING WILL BE PHASED IN FROM 1997 FOR 
EXISTING INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE ACTIVITIES.

* ENVIRONMENTAL CROSS-COMPLIANCE AS A STANDARD CONSIDERATION WILL BE EXTENDED IN 
RESPECT OF AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT, I.E. WIDER USE OF ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS AS 
A CONDITION FOR SUPPORT PAYMENTS.

* NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT PLANNING (AS NOW STATUTORILY PROVIDED FOR IN THE WASTE 
MANAGEMENT ACT), WILL BE PROMOTED ON A MANDATORY BASIS BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
WHERE AGRICULTURE IS IDENTIFIED AS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO EUTROPHICATION 
OF RIVERS AND LAKES. EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON SUCH PLANNING ON INDIVIDUAL 
FARMS, AND IN WATER CATCHMENTS AND REGIONAL AREAS.

* WE WILL AIM TO SECURE APPROVAL FOR, AND AN  UPTAKE OF 30% OF FARMERS IN THE 
REPS BY THE YEAR 1999.

FORESTRY

* NEW LEGAL POWERS WILL BE TAKEN TO MAKE PLANNING PERMISSION A REQUIREMENT FOR 
PLANTATIONS WHICH WOULD NOT WARRANT EIA.

MARINE RESOURCES

* WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT EFFORTS UNDER THE EU COMMON FISHERIES POLICY (CFP) 
TO OPTIMISE THE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF SEA FISHERIES. 

* WE WILL RATIFY THE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT OF 
THE NORTH EAST ATLANTIC (OSPAR) INCLUDING ALL IRISH COASTAL WATERS IN 1997.

* AN INVENTORY OF CHEMICAL MUNITIONS DUMP SITES AROUND THE IRISH COAST WILL BE 
DEVELOPED AS PART OF A JOINT PREPARATION OF A QUALITY STATUS REPORT BY THE IRISH 
AND UK AUTHORITIES UNDER THE OSPAR CONVENTION.

* A NEW SALMON MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED ON A PHASED BASIS.

* WE WILL SEEK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A STRICT NEW CODE ON THE SHIPMENT OF 
NUCLEAR MATERIALS, AND IN PARTICULAR TO HAVE THE EXISTING CODE ON THE SAFE 
CARRIAGE OF IRRADIATED NUCLEAR FUEL (THE INF CODE) MADE MANDATORY.

* LABOUR PROPOSES THE BANNING OF THE LOCATION OF NEW WASTE LANDFILLS NEAR COASTS 
IN ESTUARIES, RATHER THAN MERELY "REQUESTING" LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO DO SO.

TOURISM

* PLANNING AUTHORITIES WILL MAKE PROVISION IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR 
SUSTAINABLE TOURISM, AND ENSURE THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS THAT 
OVERDEVELOPMENT DOES NOT TAKE PLACE. APPROPRIATE GUIDELINES WILL BE ISSUED ON 
GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT TO THE TOURIST ACCOMMODATION SECTOR.

* MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT ALL RIVER CRUISERS LICENSED FOR HIRE ARE 
FITTED WITH APPROPRIATE STORAGE AND PUMPING FACILITIES. COMPLEMENTARY SHORE 
PUMPING FACILITIES MUST BE READILY AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE 
GRAND AND ROYAL CANALS AND THE SHANNON SYSTEM.

* RESEARCH WILL BE COMMISSIONED ON THE "CRITICAL LOADS" OF TOURIST DESTINATIONS, 
INCLUDING SENSITIVE COASTAL OR WILDERNESS AREAS, TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF SUSTAINABLE TOURIST NUMBERS.
INDUSTRY

* PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY INITIATIVES (SUCH AS THE REPAK SCHEME) WILL BE 
ENCOURAGED TO INCREASE REUSE AND RECYCLING OF WASTES. THERE WILL BE REGULATORY 
SUPPORT TO ENSURE FAIR COMPETITION.

* THE EPA, IN COOPERATION WITH THE CENTRAL STATISTICS OFFICE (CSO) AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT, ENERGY & COMMUNICATIONS, WILL DEVELOP A MATERIALS AND 
ENERGY BALANCE FOR INDUSTRY TO DETERMINE THE FULL EXTENT OF INDUSTRY'S 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE IMPACTS. THE EPA WILL ADVISE ON TARGETS FOR 
GREATER ECO-EFFICIENCY.

* THE EXTENSION OF THE EU ECOMANAGEMENT AND AUDIT SCHEME (EMAS) TO ALL MAJOR 
INDUSTRIAL SITES WILL BE ACTIVELY PROMOTED.

* A POLLUTION EMISSIONS REGISTER WILL BE PUBLISHED BY THE EPA IN 1997. 
REGULATIONS WILL BE INTRODUCED SUBSEQUENTLY TO ESTABLISH BY 1998 A MORE COMPLETE 
TOXICS RELEASE INVENTORY.

* THE EPA WILL COMPLETE A NATIONAL HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN BY 1998.

* FORBAIRT AND AN BORD TRACHT·LA, WITH THE MARINE INSTITUTE AS APPROPRIATE, WILL 
EXPLORE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IRISH INDUSTRY IN THE GROWTH AREA OF ENVIRONMENTAL 
INDUSTRY, INCLUDING POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT, AND ENVIRONMENT 
CONSULTANCY SERVICES.

FOOD SAFETY AND CONSUMERS

58	LABOUR BELIEVES THAT THE WELFARE CONCERNS AND RIGHTS OF CONSUMERS MUST 
TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY. THESE CONCERNS 
CENTRE ON THE SAFETY, THE NUTRITIONAL MERIT, THE COST AS WELL AS ETHICAL 
CONCERNS IN RELATION TO THE METHODS OF FOOD PRODUCTION. THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS 
OF THOSE WHO PRODUCE FOOD MUST BE SEEN AS SECONDARY TO THE OVER RIDING 
IMPORTANCE OF CONSUMERS.

59	IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT A CLEARLY DEFINED STRUCTURE TO ENSURE FOOD SAFETY IS 
ESTABLISHED AND PROPERLY FUNDED AND MANAGED. THE NEW FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY 
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT IS A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT. ITS AUDITING AND 
SUPERVISORY POWERS IN RELATION TO FOOD SAFETY AND ITS CAPACITY TO ACT DIRECTLY 
IN EMERGING SITUATIONS WILL BE IMPORTANT. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE NEW 
AUTHORITY IS FUNDED ADEQUATELY AND THAT IT ENGAGES THE RIGHT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE 
TO BUILD PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN ITS OPERATIONS. THE PUBLIC NOW DEMANDS GENUINE 
PERFORMANCE IN CONSUMER PROTECTION, AND NOT JUST PROMISES FROM FARMERS, 
PROCESSORS, DISTRIBUTORS AND POLITICIANS.

60	THERE SHOULD BE A SPECIALLY DEDICATED ENFORCEMENT UNIT WITHIN THE FOOD 
SAFETY AUTHORITY. THIS UNIT SHOULD HAVE SENIOR STATUS WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF 
THE AUTHORITY, AND IT COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE THE TITLE "COMMISSIONER OF FOOD 
SAFETY".

61	A CENTRAL FOOD SAFETY LABORATORY EQUIPPED TO COMPILE AND ANALYSE THE DATA 
NECESSARY TO ENFORCE SAFE FOOD STANDARDS IS ESSENTIAL.  STANDARDS ON A PAR WITH 
THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD MUST BE SET WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE ESTABLISHED 
FOOD PATHOGENS SUCH AS SALMONELLA AND CAMPYLOBACTER. 


	 THESE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST CASES OF FOOD POISONING.  WHILE UNDER-
REPORTING OF CASES AND OUTBREAKS OF FOOD POISONING IS ACCEPTED AS THE DE FACTO 
SITUATION INTERNATIONALLY, UNLESS REASONABLE BASELINE DATA IS ACCUMULATED ON THE 
ACTUAL NUMBER OF CASES AND OUTBREAKS OF FOOD BORNE ILLNESS, IT WILL PROVE 
DIFFICULT TO PUT IN PLACE AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAMME TO ENSURE A REAL REDUCTION IN 
THE NUMBERS OF INCIDENTS.

62	TO COUNTER THIS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT GENERAL PRACTITIONERS ARE 
ENCOURAGED TO REPORT CASES OF FOOD POISONING. IN RELATION TO THE EMERGING FOOD 
HAZARDS SUCH AS BSE IN BEEF AND THE OCCURRENCE OF E.COLI O157 (THE NEW HAMBURGER 
BUG), IT IS SUGGESTED THAT A CO-OPERATION AGREEMENT SHOULD BE MADE BETWEEN THE 
LABORATORY HERE DEALING WITH FOOD SAFETY AND A NUMBER OF FOOD SAFETY 
LABORATORIES IN THE UK, EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT 
IRISH EXPERTISE ON EMERGING FOOD HAZARDS WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE BEST AVAILABLE 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.  IT IS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT A COMPREHENSIVE EXCHANGE 
PROGRAMME BETWEEN FOOD SCIENTISTS IN IRISH LABORATORIES AND THOSE OVERSEAS BE 
PUT IN PLACE.

63	WITHIN THE AMBIT OF EU REGULATIONS, THERE MUST BE CLEAR REGULATIONS ON THE 
USE OF FOOD ADDITIVES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE REDUCTION OF THE LEVEL OF 
ADDITIVES IN FOODS TO THE LOWEST LEVELS COMPATIBLE WITH SAFETY, CONVENIENCE AND 
COST.  THE FSA WOULD BE CHARGED WITH ENFORCING THESE STANDARDS AND ENSURING THAT 
THE LEVELS OF ADDITIVES IN FOODS WERE IN ACCORD WITH THE LEVELS SPECIFIED ON THE 
LABELS.

64	WE PROPOSE: 
* THE TESTING OF ALL ANIMALS FOR DRUG RESIDUES PRIOR TO SLAUGHTER AS PART OF THE 
VETERINARY PRE-MORTEM  EXAMINATION OF ANIMALS


* THAT IT SHOULD BE AN OFFENCE TO OFFER FOR SALE ANIMAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN 
CONSUMPTION IF MINIMAL WITHDRAWAL PERIODS AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION OF DRUGS IS 
NOT ADHERED TO
* THE FORMULATION AND INTRODUCTION OF STRICT CONTROLS TO PREVENT THE OVER USE OF 
FERTILIZERS.  SPECIAL GUIDELINES NEED TO BE COMPILED WHICH WILL SET LIMITS ON 
THE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF FERTILIZER USED IN CROP PRODUCTION
* THE INTRODUCTION OF A LICENSING SYSTEM FOR THE REGULATION OF PESTICIDES AND 
HERBICIDES USED IN PLANT PRODUCTION.  THE MORE HAZARDOUS OF THESE PRODUCTS 
SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON "PRESCRIPTION" ONLY
* THE LICENSING OF ALL RETAIL FOOD OUTLETS SO AS TO ENSURE THAT MINIMAL 
STANDARDS OF HYGIENE ARE NOT UNDERMINED BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE FACILITIES THAT 
INCREASE THE RISK OF FOOD CONTAMINATION WITH PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISMS
* THE LABELLING OF FOOD SHOULD BE AS COMPREHENSIVE AS IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE 
SIZE OF LABELS. THEY SHOULD CONTAIN INFORMATION ON COOKING INSTRUCTIONS, STORAGE 
PROCEDURES, NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION AND A DECLARATION OF ADDITIVES OR POTENTIAL 
ALLERGENS IN THE FOOD
* A SPECIALLY TARGETED PROGRAMME OF NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION DESIGNED TO LESSEN 
THE RISKS AND CONSEQUENCES OF EATING DISORDERS SUCH AS BULIMIA AND ANOREXIA 
NERVOSA.

ETHICAL CONCERNS ON PRODUCTION METHODS

65	THE PAST TEN YEARS HAS SEEN A GROWING CONCERN AMONG THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE 
ETHICAL ASPECTS OF FOOD PRODUCTION.  THE PUBLIC NOW RECOIL FROM MANY OF THE 
TECHNOLOGIES USED IN "FACTORY FARMING".  THE FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY SHOULD HAVE A 
SUPERVISORY ROLE TO MONITOR SUCH PRACTICES, AND IF NECESSARY SHOULD RECOMMEND 
LEGISLATORS THAT UNACCEPTABLE PRACTICES BE OUTLAWED.

GENETIC METHODS

66	THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT THE POSSIBLE DANGERS THAT 
COULD ARISE FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MATERIALS OR FOODS. 
THERE IS A NEED FOR AN ADEQUATE  LICENSING SYSTEM SO AS TO ENSURE THAT THEY DO 
NOT POSE ANY THREAT TO THE HEALTH OF THE CONSUMER. A COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS SHOULD 
ADVISE THE FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY ON THE RISKS AND ISSUES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO 
THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. 

67	A SIMILAR LICENCING PROCESS WILL APPLY TO NOVEL FOODS SUCH AS NEW PROTEINS 
PRODUCED BY THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY EITHER AS MAIN INGREDIENTS OR TYPES OF FOOD 
ADDITIVES. NEW METHODS OF FOOD PROCESSING WILL ALSO FALL WITHIN THE REMIT OF A 
SIMILAR CONTROL MECHANISM. NEW FOOD PROCESSING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS THE 
IRRADIATION OF FOODS SHOULD REQUIRE A LICENCE AND SIMILAR LABELLING REQUIREMENTS 
WOULD APPLY TO THESE PROCESSES AS APPLY TO GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOODS. 


 CULTURAL IDENTITY

68	THE TALENT AND CREATIVITY OF IRISH PEOPLE HAS BEEN PROJECTED THROUGH 
LITERATURE, MUSIC AND THE VISUAL ARTS WITH CONSIDERABLE PRIDE IN RECENT YEARS. 
THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY EVENTS 
SUCH AS L'IMAGINAIRE IRLANDAISE IN FRANCE. THIS CONFIDENT EXPRESSION OF OUR 
CULTURAL IDENTITY THROUGH THE ARTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE FOSTERED THROUGH:

_ THE CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE
_ SUPPORT PROGRAMMES FOR THE WORK OF CREATIVE AND PERFORMING ARTISTS
_ A GROWING EMPHASIS ON ACCESS TO THE ARTS IN OUR SCHOOLS
_ TARGETED PROGRAMMES TO PROMOTE INCLUSION IN THE CULTURAL SPACE FOR 
MARGINALISED GROUPS
_ THE PROMOTION OF EUROPEAN IDENTITY THROUGH CULTURAL PARTNERSHIPS

ARTS & CULTURE

69	THREE YEARS OF THE ARTS PLAN HAS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES. FUNDING 
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE ARTS PLAN WILL BE PROVIDED.

70	A SIGNIFICANT START HAS BEEN MADE IN BUILDING A REGIONAL NETWORK OF 
THEATRES, ART GALLERIES, MUSEUMS AND ARTS CENTRES AT MORE THAN 30 LOCATIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THIS WILL BE COMPLETED BY 1999, AND WILL BE FOLLOWED BY 
A FURTHER FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN. 

71	LABOUR WILL PUT IN PLACE A DEFINITE BUILDING PLAN FOR THE NATIONAL MUSEUM 
AT COLLINS BARRACKS IN DUBLIN. THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE 
ABBEY THEATRE WILL BE ADDRESSED.

72	LABOUR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE ARTS CAN PLAY A CENTRAL PART IN ANY COMMUNITY 
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. 

73	RESOURCES WILL BE TARGETED TO ENCOURAGE COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN ARTS ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS TO ACCESS 
HIGH QUALITY PERFORMANCES AND EXHIBITIONS. THE RANGE OF CULTURAL SERVICES TO 
COMMUNITIES WILL INCLUDE PROJECTS TO FOSTER AN UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT FOR THE 
HERITAGE OF THEIR OWN LOCALITY.

74	THE ARTS AWARENESS INTERVENTION PROGRAMME FOR THE LONGTERM UNEMPLOYED WAS 
DEVELOPED BY "CREATIVE ACTIVITY FOR EVERYONE" AS A LABOUR PARTY INITIATIVE IN 
GOVERNMENT. IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO ORGANISE SIMILAR PROJECTS FOR OTHER 
MARGINALISED GROUPS AND RESOURCES WILL BE PROVIDED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

75	THE PERCENTAGE FOR ART SCHEME CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOR THE INCLUSION OF ARTS 
WORKS IN PUBLIC BUILDING PROJECTS UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT AND THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC WORKS. THE SCHEME WILL BE REVISED AND 
EXPANDED AND WILL BE EXTENDED TO THE BUILDING PROGRAMMES OF OTHER GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS.

76	LABOUR IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO THE CENTRALITY OF THE ARTS IN OUR EDUCATION 
SYSTEM. 

AN GAEILGE

77	THE SELF-CONFIDENCE OF A COMING GENERATION, WHICH BURST UPON OUR SCREENS 
WITH THE INAUGURATION OF TEILIFÌS NA GAEILGE, SHOWED YOUNG IRISH MEN AND WOMEN 
WORKING AT EASE WITH THE LATEST COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY, COMFORTABLE WITH THE 
CHALLENGES OF THE MODERN WORLD AND SECURE IN THEIR SENSE OF IDENTITY IN A 
MULTIFACETED CULTURE. THIS IS THE PROUD CONTEXT IN WHICH THE FUTURE OF THE IRISH 
LANGUAGE WILL EVOLVE.

78	THE DECLINE IN THE USE OF THE IRISH LANGUAGE HAS BEEN ARRESTED. IN THE 
LAST DECADE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING IRISH AS THEIR MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATION ON 
A REGULAR BASIS HAS STABILISED AT ABOUT 11% OF THE POPULATION.

79	A SERIES OF INITIATIVES WILL BE TAKEN, ALONG THE LINES RECOMMENDED IN THE 
REPORT TREO 2000, AIMED AT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CHOOSING TO SPEAK 
IRISH IN THEIR HOMES, IN THEIR WORK PLACES AND DURING THEIR LEISURE TIME. A 
STRATEGIC PLAN TO ACHIEVE A LEVEL OF 15% OVER THE NEXT DECADE WILL BE DRAWN UP.

81	LABOUR BELIEVES IN THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF THE FAMILY IN THE PROMOTION 
OF THE IRISH LANGUAGE IN THE COMMUNITY. BORD NA GAEILGE WILL BE ASKED TO PROVIDE 
INFORMATION AND ADVICE PROGRAMMES FOR FAMILIES ON THE LANGUAGE OPTIONS AND 
SERVICES AVAILABLE. A SPECIAL SUPPORT PROGRAMME WILL BE SET UP TO ENCOURAGE 
PARENTS IN SPEAKING IRISH TO THEIR CHILDREN.

82	BUILDING ON THE WORK OF RECENT YEARS THE PROMOTION OF BILINGUALISM IN 
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES WITH A VIEW TO PROVIDING SERVICES IN 
IRISH TO THOSE WHO SEEK THIS RIGHT WILL CONTINUE. IN ADDITION, LEGISLATION TO 
CODIFY THE RIGHTS OF THOSE SPEAKING THE IRISH LANGUAGE AS THEIR PRINCIPAL 
LANGUAGE, WILL BE INTRODUCED.

83	AN G M - THE IRISH PUBLICATIONS BRANCH - WILL DEVELOP A FIVE TO EIGHT YEAR 
PROGRAMME FOR THE PROVISION OF A COMPLETE RANGE OF IRISH LANGUAGE TEXTBOOKS AND 
DICTIONARIES. 

84	THE COMMISSION ON SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION NEEDS WILL INITIATE A NATIONAL 
STUDY TO MEASURE THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR ALL-IRISH SCHOOLING AT THE PRIMARY AND 
POST PRIMARY LEVELS.

85	A TEN YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR IRISH- MEDIUM EDUCATION WILL BE 
FORMULATED. 

86	A PROJECT-BASED SYSTEM FOR FUNDING VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS PROMOTING THE 
IRISH LANGUAGE WILL BE PHASED IN.

HERITAGE 

87	AUTONOMOUS GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE NATIONAL MUSEUM AND THE 
NATIONAL LIBRARY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN THE CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS ACT 1997. OUR 
OBJECTIVE IS TO RAISE THE NATIONAL CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS FOR HERITAGE TO A LEVEL 
COMPARABLE TO THEIR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS. 

88	THERE IS NEED TO PROVIDE FOR A PHASED EXPANSION OF RECRUITMENT OF THE 
PROFESSIONAL SKILLED STAFF THAT ARE NECESSARY. LABOUR PROPOSES THAT A THREE 
PERSON GROUP - AN INDEPENDENT CHAIRPERSON AND NOMINEES OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF 
FINANCE AND ARTS, CULTURE & THE GAELTACHT - WILL IDENTIFY THE STAFF NEEDS AND 
RECOMMEND THE APPROPRIATE PHASING.

89	LABOUR HAS DEVELOPED INTEGRATED PROPOSALS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE 
COUNTRY'S ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE. OUR PLAN IS:
_ TO PUT THE NATIONAL ARCHITECTURAL INVENTORY ON A STATUTORY FOOTING
_ TO PROVIDE FOR THE LISTING OF IMPORTANT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL BUILDINGS 
BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL GUIDELINES
_ TO HAVE A SYSTEM OF STATE GRANTS AND RELIEFS TOWARDS THE MAINTENANCE OF THESE 
BUILDINGS.

90	LABOUR WILL SPONSOR LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH NATURAL HERITAGE AREAS 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THIS WILL GIVE PROTECTION TO IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRYSIDE. IT WILL ALSO ENABLE IRELAND TO RATIFY THE CONVENTION ON 
INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN ENDANGERED SPECIES.


91	THE VIBRANCY OF OUR CULTURAL LIFE AND THE RICHNESS OF OUR COUNTRYSIDE IN 
HERITAGE SITES AND MONUMENTS IS A MAJOR FEATURE IN IRELAND'S ATTRACTION AS A 
TOURIST DESTINATION. TO ENSURE AUTHENTICITY, IT IS DESIRABLE TO HAVE INTEGRATED 
CULTURAL PROJECTS ROOTED IN THE COMMUNITY WHICH CAN ULTIMATELY BE SHARED WITH 
THE VISITOR.

BROADCASTING

92	LABOUR BELIEVES IT VITAL THAT IRISH PEOPLE SHOULD CONTINUE TO ENJOY:
_ ACCESS FOR EXPRESSION ON THE AIRWAVES, AND
_ THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ROOTED IN THEIR OWN CULTURAL EXPERIENCE.


93	RTE WILL BE STRENGTHENED LEGALLY AND FINANCIALLY AS THE NATIONAL 
BROADCASTER.

94	THERE IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE A MAJOR SHIFT IN THE BROADCASTING 
ENVIRONMENT IN THE WAKE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND THE TELEVISION AMBITIONS OF 
MARKET DRIVEN TRANSNATIONAL CONGLOMERATES. IRISH BASED ENTREPRENEURS MUST BE 
ABLE TO DEVELOP AS BROADCASTERS, TO PROMOTE A GENUINE MIXED MODEL OF RADIO AND 
TELEVISION PROVIDERS, WITH STRONG COMMUNITY LOYALTIES ENCOURAGED BY INDIGENOUS 
TALENT.

95	LABOUR WILL  SET UP BY STATUTE A BROADCASTING COMMISSION, ALONG THE LINES 
PUBLISHED BY MICHAEL D. HIGGINS, TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 
FOR A RESILIENT, FLEXIBLE APPROACH IN THE COMING DECADES.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE CULTURAL INDUSTRIES

96	FILM, PUBLISHING AND MUSIC HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE JOB RICH ENTERPRISES. 
LABOUR IN GOVERNMENT HAVE PROMOTED STRONGLY THE INDIGENOUS FILM INDUSTRY, AND 
THE INCENTIVES NECESSARY TO ENSURE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE MAINTAINED AND 
REFINED. A START HAS BEEN MADE IN GROWING THE MUSIC SECTOR BY THE EXTENSION OF 
THE BUSINESS EXPANSION SCHEME TO MUSIC RELATED INVESTMENTS. A MUSIC BOARD WILL 
BE ESTABLISHED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE SUPPORTS FOR 
DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS.

PLANNING & FUNDING

97	IRELAND'S PER CAPITA EXPENDITURE ON CULTURAL SERVICES HAS TRADITIONALLY 
LAGGED BEHIND EUROPEAN NORMS. LABOUR HAS FOCUSED ON CULTURAL PLANNING AND, OVER 
THE LAST FOUR YEARS, HAS GIVEN AN IMPETUS TO SECTORAL REFORM AND RENEWAL.

98	MANY ISSUES REMAIN TO BE ADDRESSED AND FOR THIS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL 
BE REQUIRED. AT PRESENT ABOUT 0.9% OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IS ALLOCATED FOR 
CULTURAL PURPOSES. LABOUR PROPOSES TO RAISE THIS STEADILY.

A LIFETIME 
OF LEARNING

INTRODUCTION

1	OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST SKILLED NATIONS IN THE WORLD 
WITH RELEVANT SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY.  
EXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION IS A CRUCIAL INVESTMENT. IT MUST  INCLUDE EARLY 
EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION, AND FACILITATE LIFE-LONG LEARNING.

2	LIFELONG LEARNING IS A CENTRAL THEME OF OUR MESSAGE. ON THE ONE HAND, A 
RAPIDLY CHANGING ECONOMY DEMANDS ECONOMIC FLEXIBILITY. ON THE OTHER, PEOPLE HAVE 
A RIGHT TO A REASONABLE LEVEL OF INCOME SECURITY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR 
FAMILIES. ACHIEVING BOTH WILL BE THE KEY MEASURE OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SUCCESS.

3	IN THE FUTURE, THE MARKET PLACE WILL CHANGE MORE RAPIDLY THAN IN THE PAST.  
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF WELL-REMUNERATED WORK.  HOWEVER, THE NOTION OF THE 
PERMANENT JOB WILL GREATLY DIMINISH IN IMPORTANCE. 

4	THE AIM WILL BE, THROUGH CONTINUOUS OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING AND FOR 
APPROPRIATE TRAINING, AND THROUGH MODIFYING WHERE NECESSARY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
STRUCTURES, TO ENSURE THAT ALL CITIZENS ARE ENABLED TO BE IN A POSITION THAT 
THEY ARE CAPABLE OF BEING EMPLOYED THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIMES.  

5	THOUSANDS OF JOBS ARE DISAPPEARING EVERY YEAR IN IRELAND, WHILE MORE ARE 
BEING CREATED. SPECIFIC STEPS WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHOSE JOBS 
BECOME REDUNDANT ARE GIVEN A REAL AND BETTER CHANCE OF MOVING INTO MORE OF THE 
NEWLY CREATED JOBS.

6	AS WE APPROACH THE 21ST CENTURY, THE WORLD IS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF A 
REVOLUTION AS PROFOUND AND ALL-PERVASIVE AS THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION OF THE 
LAST CENTURY.  IRELAND FELL ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. THE 
CONSEQUENCES OVER THE SUBSEQUENT CENTURY AND A HALF WERE DEVASTATING. 

7	BECAUSE THIS TIME WE HAVE GREATER CONTROL OVER OUR NATIONAL DESTINY, IT IS 
WITHIN OUR ABILITIES TO ENSURE THAT THIS TIME, THE  INFORMATION REVOLUTION DOES 
NOT LEAVE US BEHIND.

8	THE NEW AGE PROMISES THE ABILITY TO LIBERATE PEOPLE FROM DRUDGERY, TO 
ORGANISE OUR SOCIETY WITH COLLEGIAL AND CO-OPERATIVE NETWORKS AND FEWER COMMAND-
AND- CONTROL HIERARCHIES.  IT ALSO OFFERS AT LEAST SOME POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO 
THE OVERUSE OF THE PLANET'S NATURAL RESOURCES.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE ALSO REAL 
DANGERS:  EVERY PERIOD OF RAPID CHANGE THREATENS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL, 
WITH CONSEQUENT MARGINALISATION FOR SOME.  
STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION AGE

9	A GOOD START HAS BEEN MADE TO PREPARING A CO-ORDINATED NATIONAL STRATEGY 
FOR MANAGING THIS ENORMOUS CHANGE WITH THE ACTIONS ANNOUNCED FOLLOWING THE 
REPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INFORMATION SOCIETY STEERING COMMITTEE.  

10	BUILDING ON THE MOMENTUM NOW CREATED, LABOUR'S OBJECTIVE IS TO ENSURE THAT 
OUR NATIONAL STRATEGY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING POINTS.

11	THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WILL PLAY THE MOST CRITICAL ROLE OF ALL IN EQUIPPING 
THE COUNTRY FOR THE INFORMATION AGE.  LABOUR IN GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY LAUNCHED 
THE SCHOOLS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 2000 PROGRAMME AND RELATED INITIATIVES, WHICH 
WILL COST £30M, TO HELP TOWARDS ACHIEVING A QUANTUM LEAP IN IT PROVISION FOR 
SCHOOLS. 

12	WE WILL FOLLOW THIS BY SETTING A TARGET DATE, IN AGREEMENT WITH THE 
PARTIES CONCERNED, BY WHICH ALL TEACHERS IN THE COUNTRY ARE EQUIPPED WITH BOTH 
THE SKILLS AND EQUIPMENT TO USE THE INTERNET AND OTHER NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS A 
RESOURCE IN TEACHING THEIR SUBJECTS. 

13	WE WILL ALSO SET A GOAL OF ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL IT LITERACY, WHICH IS 
BECOMING AS ESSENTIAL TO PARTICIPATING FULLY IN THE LABOUR MARKET AS LITERACY 
ITSELF.

14	IN THE INFORMATION AGE CITIZENS WILL FIND IT NECESSARY TO THINK EVEN MORE 
FOR THEMSELVES. THEY WILL NOT WISH TO BE CLOSELY SUPERVISED. THEY WILL WANT TO 
USE THEIR OWN INITIATIVE TO GET THINGS DONE, AND BE ABLE TO MAKE CONNECTIONS 
BETWEEN SEEMINGLY UNRELATED ISSUES.  

15	WE WILL TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM DEVELOPS THESE 
ABILITIES EVEN MORE STRONGLY IN FUTURE.

16	LABOUR WILL INVESTIGATE WAYS IN WHICH SOCIAL COHESION CAN BE ENHANCED BY 
ENSURING ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WOULD 
OTHERWISE MISS OUT ON THE IT REVOLUTION. IN ADDITION, LABOUR AIMS TO INSTALL 
INTERNET CONNECTIONS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

17	VOLUNTARY AND COMMUNITY GROUPS SHOULD BE GIVEN PARTICULAR ASSISTANCE IN 
ACQUIRING AND LEARNING TO USE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS.

18	WE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION WHICH 
LABOUR HAS PROMOTED TO OPEN UP ACCESS TO ALL FORMS OF GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS, 
STATISTICS, AND OTHER INFORMATION TO CITIZENS OVER THE NETWORK.

19	WE WILL SET TARGETS FOR ALL PUBLIC SERVICES TO BE MADE AVAILABLE OVER THE 
ELECTRONIC NETWORK.  FOR EXAMPLE, WELFARE PAYMENTS COULD BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH 
CASH MACHINES, TAX RETURNS COULD BE SENT ELECTRONICALLY, PLANNING APPLICATIONS 
COULD SIMILARLY BE PROCESSED OVER THE NETWORK.  THIS WOULD HAVE TWO MAJOR 
BENEFITS.  ON THE ONE HAND IT WOULD PROVIDE CITIZENS WITH BETTER QUALITY AND 
MORE CONVENIENT SERVICES, AND ON THE OTHER IT WOULD PROVIDE A POWERFUL STIMULUS 
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOPHISTICATED NATIONAL MARKET FOR ADVANCED SERVICES.  

20	THIS IN TURN WOULD PROVIDE A RICHER ENVIRONMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
SUCCESSFUL IT-RELATED COMPANIES, IN WHAT IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE MOST POWERFUL 
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN THE WORLD ECONOMY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

21	WE ALSO AIM TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE WITH BROADBAND 
LINKS TO EVERY SCHOOL AND LIBRARY IN THE COUNTRY, WITH INTERACTIVE VIDEO 
CAPABILITY AT EVERY LOCATION, AND WITH SUPPORT FOR LOCAL SKILLS TRAINING IN 
USING THE TECHNOLOGY. EVERY COMMUNITY MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THE NEW AGE OF 
INFORMATION.

22	WE ALSO SUPPORT THE PROMOTION OF MAJOR FLAGSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND 
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS SUCH AS DIGITAL INDUSTRIAL PARTS AND TELECOM EIREANN'S 
INFORMATION AGE TOWN.

23	AND WE AIM TO ENCOURAGE THE GROWTH OF VOLUME IN NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS BY 
MOVING TOWARDS THE LOWEST POSSIBLE PRICE LEVELS, WITH ADEQUATE MEASURES FOR RE-
TRAINING PEOPLE DISPLACED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS, TO EQUIP THEM FOR NEW JOB 
OPPORTUNITIES.

24	WE WILL SET UP A SPECIFIC PROGRAMME OFFICE TO CO-ORDINATE PROJECTS AND 
MONITOR PROGRESS AGAINST TARGETS.

EQUALITY AND PARTNERSHIP

25	LABOUR BELIEVES THAT EQUALITY BEGINS AT THE VERY EARLIEST STAGE OF 
EDUCATION  -  THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BEGUN, AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT, THE EARLY 
START PRE-SCHOOL PROGRAMME, THE BREAKING THE CYCLE PRIMARY SCHOOL PROGRAMME, 
LOWER CLASS SIZES IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS, AND RENEWING THE CURRICULUM AT PRIMARY 
LEVEL.

26	REAL EDUCATION MUST INVOLVE PARENTS AS FULL PARTNERS AND WE ARE PUTTING IN 
PLACE THE STRUCTURES TO ENSURE THIS. THE AIM IS PARTNERSHIP WITH PARENTS IN THE 
SCHOOLS, IN THE PARENTS' ASSOCIATIONS, IN BOARDS OF MANAGEMENT AND REGIONAL 
EDUCATION BOARDS, AND BY INVOLVING PARENTS IN NATIONAL POLICY.

27	BUT MANY ADULTS AND PARENTS DID NOT GET THE CHANCE TO BENEFIT FROM 
EDUCATION IN THE PAST. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NOW GO TO THE 
LEAVING CERTIFICATE AND BEYOND. THIS IS NOT TRUE OF MANY OF THEIR PARENTS. WE 
MUST SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW ADULTS TO RETURN TO EDUCATION, TO BUILD 
THEIR SKILLS, TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN OUR CONFIDENT SOCIETY 
BOTH AT WORK AND IN LEISURE.

28	LABOUR WILL ENSURE THAT SUITABLE AND EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMES ARE IN PLACE FOR 
ALL WHO WISH TO OVERCOME LITERACY AND NUMERACY PROBLEMS AND WHO WISH TO CONTINUE 
LEARNING THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES.  

29	ADULT EDUCATION, PROVIDED THROUGH VARIOUS AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN AND DISTANCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES, WILL PROMOTE LIFELONG 
LEARNING AND CONTINUOUS RE-TRAINING. 

30	WE AIM TO HELP ADULTS GAIN ACCESS TO COURSES IN MAINSTREAM SECOND LEVEL 
AND THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION. THERE SHOULD BE INCREASED CO-OPERATION BETWEEN 
PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYERS, AND TARGETING OF ADULTS WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS - 
INCLUDING THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED AND THOSE WITH LITERACY AND NUMERACY 
PROBLEMS.  

31	EXISTING MEASURES SUCH AS THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES SCHEME 
(VTOS) AND THE ADULT LITERACY COMMUNITY EDUCATION SCHEME WILL BE ENHANCED.

32	LIFELONG LEARNING MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THEIR 
EDUCATION AND THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN IF ALL CITIZENS AND ALL PARTNERS IN EDUCATION 
KNOW THEIR RIGHTS, THEIR ROLES AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.  THAT'S WHY WE 
BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN THE HISTORY OF OUR STATE.

33	THIS HELPS US FOCUS ON EQUALITY - EQUALITY FOR ALL OUR CITIZENS IN 
BENEFITING FROM EDUCATION. IT BRINGS US INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF PRACTICE IN 
EUROPE - A EUROPE WITH WHICH OUR SUCCESSFUL YOUNG PEOPLE INCREASINGLY IDENTIFY. 

34	THE NEW FRAMEWORK WILL PROMOTE A GENUINE PLURALISM - A PLURALISM WHERE 
PROGRAMMES AND COURSES ARE GEARED TO EACH LEARNER'S NEEDS, A PLURALISM WHERE 
DIVERSITY AND DIFFERENT SCHOOL TYPES AND TRADITIONS ARE ENCOURAGED AND WELCOMED, 
A PLURALISM WHERE EACH CITIZEN IN OUR SOCIETY KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO 
EDUCATION AND IT IS A RIGHT WHICH THEY ARE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE UP.

35	FORTY PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION ARE UNDER 25 YEARS OLD. WE OWE THESE YOUNG 
PEOPLE THE BEST OF EDUCATION. WE OWE IT ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO MAY BE EXCLUDED.  
EDUCATION IS NOT JUST ABOUT SKILLS. WE BUILD OUR ECONOMIC SUCCESS ON EDUCATION. 
WE BUILD A MORE EQUAL SOCIETY ON EDUCATION.  WE BUILD CONCERN FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT ON EDUCATION. AND THROUGH EDUCATION FOR CITIZENSHIP, WE ENCOURAGE 
EACH PERSON TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY.  

36	EDUCATION IS CENTRAL TO BUILDING A SOCIETY WHICH WORKS TO REMOVE FEAR; THE 
FEAR OF ELDERLY PEOPLE ABOUT CRIME, THE FEAR OF WOMEN ABOUT EXCLUSION, THE FEAR 
OF DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE ABOUT A HOPELESS FUTURE.

37	LABOUR PROPOSES TO BUILD ON THE PARTNERSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN OUTLINED IN 
NIAMH BHREATHNACH'S WHITE PAPER ON EDUCATION AND WHICH HAS BEEN EMBODIED IN THE 
EDUCATION BILL AND THE UNIVERSITIES ACT.

38	IN PARTICULAR, WE WILL ESTABLISH WAYS BY WHICH PARENTS, TEACHERS, SCHOOL 
PATRONS AND OTHERS INTERESTED IN EDUCATION WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE PLANNING OF 
EDUCATION, WILL HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD AND WILL BE CONSULTED AS DECISIONS ARE 
MADE.

IN THE REGIONS

39	THE AIM IS TO EMPOWER COMMUNITIES TO PLAN FOR EDUCATION IN EACH REGION 
THROUGH THE EDUCATION BOARDS.  THE EDUCATION BOARDS WILL BE REPRESENTATIVE OF 
ALL THE PARTNERS IN EDUCATION. THEY WILL PLAN EDUCATION IN THEIR REGION AND 
CONSULT WIDELY ON THE EDUCATION PLAN FOR THE REGION. THE DRAFT PLAN WILL BE 
ADVERTISED ON LOCAL MEDIA, IN THE PAPERS, AND ON LOCAL RADIO. 

40	THE EDUCATION BOARD WILL SET UP FORMAL MECHANISMS FOR CONSULTATION WITH 
EACH COMMUNITY IN THE REGION ON HOW THE EDUCATION PLAN AFFECTS THEM. AND WHEN 
THE PLAN IS FINALISED, IT WILL BE AVAILABLE IN EVERY SCHOOL, IN EVERY PUBLIC 
LIBRARY AND WILL BE ON SALE AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. 

41	EVERY YEAR THE PLAN WILL BE REVIEWED, EVERY YEAR THERE WILL BE A REPORT, 
AND EVERY YEAR THERE WILL BE INFORMATION FREELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ON HOW 
THE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION IS BEING USED IN THEIR REGION.

42	THIS WILL BE A STAGGERING CHANGE IN THE WAY EDUCATION IS PLANNED AT THE 
MOMENT.  THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS OFTEN CRITICISED FOR BEING SECRETIVE, SLOW AND 
UNRESPONSIVE.  THE EDUCATION BOARDS, WITH THEIR DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURE, WILL 
TRANSFORM THIS TO AN OPEN ACCOUNTABLE PROCESS WHERE EACH PERSON HAS ACCESS TO 
INFORMATION ON HOW DECISIONS ARE MADE.

AT NATIONAL LEVEL

43	THESE DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURES AT REGIONAL LEVEL WILL BRING DECISIONS TO THE 
REGIONS AND LEAVE NATIONAL POLICY MAKING TO THE MINISTER AND DEPARTMENT OF 
EDUCATION.  EXAMPLES OF SUCH POLICY AREAS ARE FAIRNESS IN FUNDING OF ALL 
SCHOOLS, CURRICULUM CONTENT, AND PLANNING FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY. BUT HERE 
ALSO, DEMOCRACY DEMANDS THAT THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY EDUCATION POLICY HAVE A 
HAND IN SHAPING IT.

44	LABOUR WILL INVOLVE THE PARTNERS IN EDUCATION IN THE STRATEGIC PLANNING 
WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THROUGH CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEES. AND WHEN 
DECISIONS ARE MADE, THEY WILL BE OPENLY PUBLISHED BY LAYING OF REGULATIONS 
BEFORE THE OIREACHTAS SO THAT POLICY IS CLEARLY KNOWN AND PUBLICLY DEBATED.

45	WE WILL FOCUS ON QUALITY EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS AND ON RETURNING TO 
EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES FOR ADULTS, ESPECIALLY ADULTS WHO DID NOT 
BENEFIT FROM THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE PAST.

INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION

46	FUNDING OF EDUCATION IS AN INVESTMENT  -  AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COUNTRY'S 
PROSPERITY AND IN OUR PEOPLE'S FUTURE. OUR ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND BUOYANCY GIVES 
US A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF OUR INVESTMENT IN 
EDUCATION.  LABOUR PLEDGES A HIGH PRIORITY TO FUNDING EDUCATION.

47	IN PARTICULAR, LABOUR PROPOSES TO STEADILY RAISE THE INVESTMENT IN 
TARGETED PROGRAMMES SUCH AS EARLY START, BREAKING THE CYCLE AND GENERAL 
INTERVENTIONS IN PRIMARY AND PRE-PRIMARY EDUCATION.

AT PRE-SCHOOL

48	WITH PARENTS, LABOUR PLANS TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF THE EARLY START PRE-
SCHOOL PROGRAMME ESTABLISHED BY NIAMH BHREATHNACH IN DESIGNATED DISADVANTAGED 
AREAS.  WE WILL USE THE ADVICE OF THE EXPERT MONITORING COMMITTEE TO PLAN 
EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAMME IN CONSULTATION WITH THE EDUCATION PARTNERS.  

AT PRIMARY LEVEL

49	LABOUR'S AIM IS TO RETAIN TEACHERS IN THE SYSTEM WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE 
LOST DUE TO THE FALLING NUMBER OF PRIMARY PUPILS.  WE ARE COMMITTED TO TARGETING 
INVESTMENT WHERE IT IS NEEDED MOST  - 
_  IN AREAS OF DISADVANTAGE,
_ TO STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS,
_ TO STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS, 
_ TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE LEARNING DIFFICULTIES FOR WHATEVER REASON.

50	WE AIM TO STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND THE BREAKING THE CYCLE INITIATIVE IN 
DISADVANTAGED AREAS, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ADVICE OF THE COMBAT POVERTY AGENCY.  
NO CLASS SIZE SHOULD BE GREATER THAN 15 STUDENTS TO 1 TEACHER TO ENSURE THAT 
EXTRA SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR STUDENTS IN SUCH AREAS. WORKING WITH PARENTS IS AN 
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS PROGRAMME.

51	LABOUR WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL BOOKS FOR STUDENTS IN 
NEED.

52	WE WILL EXPAND THE REMEDIAL TEACHING SERVICE TO ENSURE THAT ALL PUPILS 
HAVE ACCESS TO A REMEDIAL SERVICE. WE WILL EXPLORE NEW MODELS OF REMEDIAL 
TEACHING TO CATER FOR SMALL SCHOOLS IN RURAL AREAS.  

53	LABOUR ESTABLISHED A PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICE IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS. A 
COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE, ENSURING THAT EVERY VULNERABLE STUDENT IS FOLLOWED UP, 
REQUIRES INTEGRATION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECOND LEVEL. 

54	USING THE DEMOGRAPHIC DIVIDEND AS THE MAJOR FUNDING MECHANISM, WE WILL 
FUND THE CREATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE, INTEGRATED SERVICE AT BOTH LEVELS. WE WILL 
PROVIDE ONE PSYCHOLOGIST FOR EVERY 5,000 STUDENTS.

55	OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO STUDENTS WITH SERIOUS LITERACY AND 
NUMERACY PROBLEMS IN EARLY PRIMARY EDUCATION WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

56	LABOUR'S AIM IS TO IMPROVE THE PUPIL/TEACHER RATIO IN SPECIAL SCHOOLS AND 
IN SPECIAL CLASSES IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS.  WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILD 
CARE ASSISTANTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PUPILS. 

57	WE WILL PROVIDE EXTRA RESOURCES TO ASSIST SPECIAL SCHOOLS AND CLASSES TO 
DEVELOP LINKS AND INTEGRATION WITH MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS SUCH 
AS VISITS, SHARED TIME-TABLING AND INTEGRATION LINKS.

58	EACH PUPIL IN OUR PRIMARY SCHOOLS SHOULD BE ASSESSED BY THEIR TEACHERS AT 
THE END OF FIRST AND FIFTH CLASS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY ANY SPECIAL LEARNING NEEDS 
THAT MAY ARISE. THIS IS AN ADDITION TO THE ORDINARY ASSESSMENT WHICH TAKES PLACE 
IN THE SCHOOL. ASSESSMENT DATA FOR EACH STUDENT WILL BE RECORDED ON STANDARD 
STUDENT PROFILE CARDS. THE INCREASED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND REMEDIAL SERVICES WILL 
ASSIST IN THE ASSESSMENT AND IN ADDRESSING ANY NEEDS WHICH THEN ARISE.

59	LABOUR IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS IN PRIMARY EDUCATION.  
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FUNDING FOR THE DAY TO DAY RUNNING OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS 
HAVE INCREASED FROM £28 PER PUPIL TO £45 PER PUPIL AND TO £75 PER PUPIL IN 
SCHOOLS DESIGNATED DISADVANTAGED.  

60	WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THIS ESSENTIAL FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS 
IN FUTURE YEARS.

61	LABOUR WILL PROMOTE CHOICE OF SCHOOL TYPE IN PRIMARY EDUCATION AT A TIME 
WHEN NUMBERS ARE FALLING; IN PARTICULAR WE WILL ACTIVATE THE PROVISION THAT 
EDUCATION BOARDS MAY OWN NEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND LEASE THEM TO DIFFERENT GROUPS 
OF PATRONS AND TRUSTEES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF EACH 
REGION.

AT SECOND LEVEL

62	RETAINING YOUNG PEOPLE IN EDUCATION TO THE END OF SENIOR CYCLE IS A MAJOR 
PRIORITY.  OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT 100% OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE COMPLETE SECOND 
LEVEL EDUCATION. 

63	TO SUPPORT THIS WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE TRANSITION YEAR AND THE 
NEW THREE STREAM LEAVING CERTIFICATE, WITH CONTINUAL SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING FOR 
TEACHER IN-CAREER DEVELOPMENT. STUDENTS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO FOLLOW COURSES OF 
THE HIGHEST LEVEL INDICATED BY THEIR CAPACITY.

64	CO-OPERATION AMONG SCHOOLS WILL BE PROMOTED THROUGH THE EDUCATION BOARDS 
SO THAT EACH REGION AND EACH TOWN MAY OFFER A FULL RANGE OF THE SECOND LEVEL 
SCHOOL PROGRAMMES TO ITS STUDENTS.  THIS MEANS THAT THROUGH CO-OPERATION BETWEEN 
SCHOOLS, ONE SCHOOL MAY OFFER THE LEAVING CERTIFICATE VOCATIONAL PROGRAMME, 
ANOTHER THE LEAVING CERTIFICATE APPLIED, ANOTHER THE JUNIOR CERTIFICATE 
ELEMENTARY PROGRAMME SO THAT THERE WILL BE A WIDE RANGE OF CHOICES AVAILABLE IN 
EACH TOWN TO YOUNG PEOPLE. THE CO-ORDINATING ROLE OF THE EDUCATION BOARDS WILL 
FACILITATE THIS CO-OPERATION. 

65	LABOUR WILL STRENGTHEN THE JUNIOR CERTIFICATE ELEMENTARY PROGRAMME AND 
GENERAL JUNIOR CERTIFICATE PROGRAMMES TO ENSURE THAT NO YOUNG PERSON DROPS OUT 
OF SCHOOL WITHOUT QUALIFICATIONS. 

66	WE WILL INCREASE AND FOCUS YOUTHREACH PLACES FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY 
LEFT SCHOOL EARLY. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH YOUTHREACH PLACES FOR 
ALL YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM AND WILL PROVIDE OUTREACH PROGRAMMES TO ENCOURAGE 
SUCH YOUNG PEOPLE BACK INTO EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT.

67	LABOUR WILL ENSURE THAT EACH STUDENT AT SECOND LEVEL WILL HAVE ACCESS TO 
THE STUDY OF A MODERN EUROPEAN LANGUAGE.  WE WILL GIVE SPECIAL INCENTIVES TO 
SECOND LEVEL SCHOOLS TO INTRODUCE A RANGE OF EUROPEAN LANGUAGES. WE WILL PROVIDE 
SPECIFIC DEDICATED FUNDING TO IN-CAREER DEVELOPMENT FOR LANGUAGE TEACHERS AND 
FOR MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED FOR LANGUAGE TEACHING.

68	RECOGNISING THAT AN ADEQUATE GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING SERVICE IS VITAL TO 
ASSIST YOUNG PEOPLE TO STAY IN EDUCATION, LABOUR WILL STRENGTHEN THE GUIDANCE 
PROVISION IN OUR SCHOOLS IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR GUIDANCE 
IN EDUCATION.

69	WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE PROVISION OF REMEDIAL EDUCATION AT SECOND LEVEL TO 
PROVIDE A CONTINUITY OF ASSISTANCE FOR PUPILS WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES FROM 
PRIMARY TO SECOND LEVEL SCHOOL.

70	WE WILL ENCOURAGE THE MOBILITY OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, CONTACT BETWEEN 
SCHOOLS AND DISTANCE EDUCATION THROUGH THE SOCRATES PROGRAMME. WE WILL FURTHER 
EXPAND THE EUROPEAN STUDIES PROJECT AND NORTH SOUTH CO-OPERATION IN EDUCATION.

71	WE WILL IMPLEMENT THE REPORT OF THE STEERING GROUP ON THE FUNDING OF 
SCHOOLS, SO THAT FAIR AND OPEN COMMON CRITERIA AND ENTITLEMENTS WILL APPLY TO 
FUNDING OF SCHOOLS IN THE SECOND LEVEL SECTOR.

AT THIRD LEVEL

72	LABOUR WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THIRD LEVEL PLACES, WITH SPECIAL 
EMPHASIS ON THE SKILLS NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY.  

73	THE HIGHER EDUCATION AUTHORITY AND THIRD LEVEL INSTITUTIONS WILL DEVELOP 
LINKS WITH SECOND LEVEL SCHOOLS SO THAT STUDENTS FROM LOWER SOCIO-ECONOMIC 
GROUPS WILL INCREASE THEIR PARTICIPATION NUMBERS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  

74	OUR TARGET IS TO ACHIEVE AN ANNUAL INCREASE IN PARTICIPATION OF AT LEAST 
500 STUDENTS FROM THESE GROUPS.

75	THE HIGHER EDUCATION MAINTENANCE GRANTS WILL BE EXTENDED TO STUDENTS 
ATTENDING PLCS.

76	LABOUR PROPOSES TO INCREASE MAINTENANCE GRANTS AT A FASTER RATE THAN 
INFLATION AND INTRODUCE A SPECIAL MAINTENANCE SCHEME SO THAT STUDENTS FROM LOWER 
SOCIO ECONOMIC GROUPS WILL BE SUPPORTED IN THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION.

77	WE WILL EXTEND THE REMIT OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION AUTHORITY TO ALL PUBLICLY 
FUNDED THIRD LEVEL COLLEGES.

78	WE WILL PREPARE LEGISLATION TO REGULATE PRIVATE COMMERCIAL COLLEGES WHOSE 
COURSES ARE ELEGIBLE FOR STATE CERTIFICATION, AND TO GUARANTEE THE ACADEMIC 
INTEGRITY AND QUALITY OF THEIR COURSES. WE WILL ALSO PRESCRIBE STANDARDS FOR 
STAFF QUALIFICATIONS, SUPPORT SERVICES AND FACILITIES AND PROTECTION FOR THE 
FINANCIAL INVESTMENT OF STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS.

GENERAL

BUILDINGS

79	THE ELIMINATION OF SUB-STANDARD SCHOOLS IS A MAJOR POLICY OBJECTIVE. THE 
BACKLOG OF PROJECTS WILL ELIMINATED WITHIN FIVE YEARS.

TEACHING PROFESSION

80	LABOUR WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST AT CURRENT LEVELS IN IN-CAREER EDUCATION OF 
TEACHERS TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF NEW CURRICULA.  

81	WE WILL ESTABLISH A TEACHER WELFARE SERVICE TO SUPPORT TEACHERS WHO ARE 
EXPERIENCING A RANGE OF DIFFICULTIES WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE SCHOOLS.  WE WILL 
ESTABLISH A TEACHING COUNCIL FOR ALL TEACHERS.

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION COMMITTEES

82	WE WILL WORK WITH VOCATIONAL EDUCATION COMMITTEES TO STRENGTHEN THE 
VOCATIONAL SECTOR BASED ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION 
NEEDS.

THE INSPECTORATE

83	INSPECTORS WILL SUPPORT SCHOOLS IN THEIR PLANNING AND SCHOOL INSPECTIONS 
WILL BE BASED ON THESE PLANS.  WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF THE INSPECTORATE 
BY 50% ON A PHASED BASIS MAINLY BY SECONDMENT OF TEACHERS WITH RECOGNISED 
COMPETENCE AND COMMITMENT TO THE INSPECTORATE FOR SPECIFIC PERIODS.

CONCLUSION

84	LABOUR'S PROPOSALS FOR LIFE LONG LEARNING AND FOR THE EVOLUTION OF THE 
FORMAL EDUCATION SYSTEM ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO OUR OTHER OBJECTIVES IN THIS 
MANIFESTO  -  THE DRIVE FOR MORE EQUALITY, FOR SOCIAL COHESION, FOR SUSTAINED 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, FOR THE BUILDING OF A JUST AND CARING SOCIETY.

IN THE WORLD 
AND IN EUROPE

LABOUR STANDS FOR:

THE CONTINUATION OF IRELAND'S NEUTRAL STATUS
OUR COMMITMENT AS A COUNTRY TO UN PEACEKEEPING
THE PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
SUPPORT FOR THOSE SEEKING TO BUILD A JUST WORLD ECONOMIC ORDER IN WHICH THE 
PEOPLE OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD WOULD BE ENABLED TO ACHIEVE SELF-SUSTAINING 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND WOULD BE RELIEVED OF THE CRUSHING BURDEN OF 
DEBT.
1	AN OPEN AND GENEROUS IRELAND, LEARNING FROM OTHER PEOPLE, AND CONTRIBUTING 
TO SOLVING HUMAN PROBLEMS. THAT'S A CORE VALUE FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF IRISH 
PEOPLE. IT IS ONE WE SHARE. 

2	SELF-CENTRED ISOLATION, OR PUTTING UP THE SHUTTERS, IS NEITHER PRACTICAL 
NOR RIGHT. THAT'S WHY ABOVE ALL WE ADVOCATE THE CONTINUED UNDERTAKING BY IRELAND 
OF A POSITIVE ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. OUR MEMBERSHIP - AND THE STRONG 
ROLE WE CAN PLAY - IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE UNITED NATIONS, THE 
EUROPEAN UNION, AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE ARE CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT.

3	IN EACH OF THESE, IRELAND HAS A VOICE AND A FORUM TO PROMOTE BOTH OUR 
INTERESTS AND OUR VALUES. LABOUR WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR COOPERATION WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES IN EFFORTS TO CREATE A STABLE FRAMEWORK FOR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 
THIS FRAMEWORK MUST REFLECT BOTH THE RIGHTS OF SMALL AND LARGE STATES AND MUST 
PROVIDE FOR THE SOLUTION OF DISPUTES BY PEACEFUL MEANS, RATHER THAN BY MILITARY 
MIGHT.

THE BROADER WORLD

4	LABOUR WOULD NOT SUPPORT IRELAND'S SEEKING FULL MEMBERSHIP OF THE WEU, NOR 
JOINING NATO. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SERIOUS DEBATE ABOUT HOW 
IRELAND CAN BEST CONTRIBUTE OUR  LONG-STANDING EXPERTISE IN AREAS SUCH AS 
PEACEKEEPING AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS TO ENSURE 
STABILITY AND TRUE SECURITY IN EUROPE. WE RECOGNISE THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF THE OSCE 
IN THE EVOLUTION OF PAN-EUROPEAN ARRANGEMENTS FOR SECURITY AND CONFLICT 
RESOLUTION.

5	THIS COULD INVOLVE ACCEPTANCE OF CERTAIN APPROPRIATE TASKS IN THE CONTEXT 
OF THIS COUNTRY'S ROLE AS AN OBSERVER WITHIN THE WEU. 

6	IT COULD BE A LEGITIMATE AND PROPER ROLE FOR IRELAND TO PARTICIPATE, IN 
DUE COURSE, IN THE PAN-EUROPEAN STRUCTURE OF THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE. THIS HAS 
ALREADY BEEN JOINED BY OTHER EUROPEAN NEUTRAL STATES SUCH AS SWITZERLAND, 
AUSTRIA, FINLAND AND SWEDEN. THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE IS NOT A MILITARY 
ALLIANCE. IRELAND WOULD BE FREE LIKE ALL OTHER COUNTRIES TO NEGOTIATE ITS OWN 
TERMS. 

7	NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT REMAINS A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF IRISH FOREIGN POLICY. 
LABOUR WILL VIGOROUSLY PURSUE THIS OBJECTIVE WITHIN AN OVERALL POLICY DESIGNED 
TO BRING ABOUT CONVENTIONAL DISARMAMENT.

8	 OUR AIM MUST BE TO RID THE WORLD OF THE HORROR OF LAND MINES AND CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS, AND TO CONTROL THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ARMAMENTS INDUSTRY AND OF 
INTERNATIONAL ARMS DEALERS.

9	THE UNITED NATIONS WILL REMAIN A CORNERSTONE OF IRISH FOREIGN POLICY. 
SUPPORT FOR EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL ACTION IN AREAS SUCH AS DISARMAMENT, 
PEACEKEEPING, DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS WILL BE GIVEN PRIORITY. THE UN MUST 
BE GIVEN THE RESOURCES AND POLITICAL SUPPORT NECESSARY TO COPE WITH THE GREAT 
WORLD PROBLEMS OF ECONOMIC DESPAIR, SOCIAL INJUSTICE AND POLITICAL OPPRESSION.

10	 CONFLICT PREVENTION MUST BE THE FIRST STEP IN ALL CONFRONTATIONS AND THE 
MEDIATION CAPACITY OF THE UN MUST BE STRENGTHENED. IRELAND WILL SEEK TO SECURE A 
MORE REPRESENTATIVE SECURITY COUNCIL AND WILL SEEK ELECTION TO THE COUNCIL IN 
THE YEAR 2000. 

11	IRISH POLICY WILL EMPHASISE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UN SPECIALIST AGENCIES 
UNICEF, UNHCR AND UNDP.

12	LABOUR BELIEVES THAT IRELAND MUST CONTINUE TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN 
PEACEKEEPING. WE WILL SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF STANDBY UNITS OF MILITARY AND 
POLICE FOR USE BY THE UN. WE WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE STRENGTHENING OF THE UN'S 
CAPACITY TO DIRECT AND MANAGE PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS.

13	LABOUR FAVOURS EXTENSION OF UN MANDATES TO COVER HUMAN RIGHTS 
CONSIDERATIONS. IRELAND HAS NO NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTION AS RECOMMENDED 
BY THE UN "PARIS PRINCIPLES". LABOUR PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN 
AUTHORITATIVE AND INDEPENDENT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AT HOME.  

14	LABOUR ADVOCATES A SIGNIFICANT PROGRAMME OF RATIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL 
CONVENTIONS AND RELEVANT UN RESOLUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, PRIORITIES FOR 
RATIFICATION WOULD INCLUDE:
_  THE UN RESOLUTION ON WAR CRIMES TRIBUNALS, 
_ THE UN CONVENTION ON ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, 
_ THE UN CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE, AND 
_ THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE'S CHILDREN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.

IRISH AID

15	WE ADVOCATE SOLIDARITY AND PARTNERSHIP AT HOME. THERE IS A MATCHING DUTY 
AND RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE A COHERENT AND EFFECTIVE IRISH POLICY IN RELATIONS 
WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. 

16	IN GOVERNMENT, LABOUR HAS WORKED TO THIS OBJECTIVE. OUR ODA CONTRIBUTIONS 
HAVE INCREASED FROM £40M OR 0.16% OF GNP IN 1992, TO AN ESTIMATED £122M OR 0.31% 
OF GNP IN 1997. 

17	DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. POLICY MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
HUMAN RIGHTS, THE ROLE OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN, ENVIRONMENT ISSUES, TRADE (IN 
PARTICULAR THE ARMS TRADE), AND DEBT LEVELS. OUR POLICIES WILL STRESS THE NEED 
TO DEAL WITH THE DEBT PROBLEM, TO COPE EFFECTIVELY WITH HUMANITARIAN ISSUES AND 
DISASTER RELIEF AND TO PROVIDE FOR A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE FOR NGOS IN POLICY 
DEVELOPMENT.

18	WE REITERATE OUR COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF THE UN ODA TARGET OF 0.7% OF 
GNP BY SYSTEMATIC ANNUAL INCREASES IN FUNDING OF BOTH MULTILATERAL ACTIVITIES 
AND IRISH INITIATIVES IN THE AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT AND HUMANITARIAN RELIEF. 

19	TO THIS END, LABOUR'S OBJECTIVES ARE:

* TO INCREASE IRISH AID BY 0.05% OF GNP PER ANNUM UNTIL THE UN TARGET IS 
REACHED.
* TO PUT THE BILATERAL PROGRAMME ON A MULTI-ANNUAL FUNDING BASIS TO ENSURE 
CONTINUITY AND PROPER DEVELOPMENT.
* TO WORK TOWARDS AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR DEBT RELIEF FOR THE POOREST 
COUNTRIES.
* TO WORK WITHIN THE EU FOR IMPROVED TRADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR DEVELOPING 
COUNTRIES.
* TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE UN DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WHILE ALSO SEEKING TO 
CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR REFORM.

THE EUROPEAN UNION

20	TOGETHER WITH OUR SISTER PARTIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, LABOUR WILL 
CONTINUE TO WORK FOR PEACE, PROSPERITY, SECURITY, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SOCIAL 
INCLUSION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. 

21	THIS WILL BE THE CASE WHETHER THE POLICIES RELATE TO DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN 
THE UNION, THE CHALLENGES OF ENLARGEMENT, RELATIONS WITH OTHER STATES OR 
COOPERATION WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

22	 AT PRESENT, THE EXTENT OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY IN EUROPE, 
THE NEED FOR SECURITY BOTH EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME 
AND DRUG ABUSE, AND THE NEED FOR A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL 
CONFERENCE (IGC) ARE KEY ISSUES. 

23	WE  SUPPORT:

* EU POLICIES DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE A HIGH LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT WHILE PROTECTING 
WORKERS' RIGHTS.
* UNION ACTION AGAINST POVERTY AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION.
* CO-ORDINATED ACTION AGAINST DRUGS AND CRIME.
* PROGRESS TOWARDS ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION WITH IRELAND QUALIFYING AND 
WILLING TO JOIN THE SINGLE CURRENCY AT ITS INCEPTION.
* EVOLUTION OF THE COHESION AND STRUCTURAL FUNDS IN WAYS WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO 
SUPPORT NECESSARY DEVELOPMENT IN IRELAND WHILE MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF 
ENLARGEMENT.

24	THERE IS NO AGREED OR WIDE RANGING VISION, COMPARABLE TO THE SINGLE MARKET 
PROJECT OR EMU, DRIVING THE EVOLUTION OF A COMMON SOCIAL POLICY WITHIN THE EU.  
YET SOME 50 MILLION EUROPEAN CITIZENS LIVE IN POVERTY. IN THE UNION THERE ARE 
SOME 18 MILLION PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED - OF WHOM HALF ARE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED. 

25	 IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION REACH THOSE WHO 
ARE MARGINALISED AND SOCIALLY EXCLUDED. FLOWS OF FUNDS FROM EU PROGRAMMES MUST 
BE CHANNELLED TO AREAS OF DISADVANTAGE AND TO PEOPLE IN POVERTY.  
26	WHILE WE ACCEPT THAT NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LIKELY TO MAINTAIN PRIMARY 
RESPONSIBILITY, LABOUR WILL PRESS FOR EU INITIATIVES TO SUPPLEMENT NATIONAL 
PROGRAMMES IN THIS AREA.

27	 IN THE CONTEXT OF IGC NEGOTIATIONS, LABOUR WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS FOR THE 
FOLLOWING:

* POLICIES FOR EMPLOYMENT MUST BE GIVEN A NEW STATUS IN THE TREATY.
* THERE MUST BE A TREATY CHANGE TO STRENGTHEN INSTITUTIONAL EFFORTS TO FIGHT 
SOCIAL EXCLUSION ACROSS ALL THE ACTIVITIES OF THE UNION.
* THE TREATY CHANGE ALREADY PROPOSED BY THE IRISH PRESIDENCY TO FIGHT 
DISCRIMINATION ON A WIDE RANGE OF GROUNDS, INCLUDING SEX, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, 
RACE, AND DISABILITY, MUST BE MAINTAINED.

28	EMU AND THE ASSOCIATED STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT WILL BRING MANY BENEFITS 
IF THEY WORK EFFECTIVELY. BUT THEY WILL NOT OF THEMSELVES ENSURE A SERIOUS 
REDUCTION OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, BALANCED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR GENUINE 
SOCIAL INCLUSION THROUGHOUT THE UNION. THERE IS NEED AND SCOPE FOR ADDITIONAL 
RADICAL MEASURES BOTH AT UNION AND NATIONAL LEVEL.

29	THE OUTCOME OF THE IGC MUST LAY SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON:

* THE PRESERVATION OF PEACE AND STABILITY ACROSS THE CONTINENT.
* THE NEED TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY, EQUITY, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
OF ALL EU STRUCTURES, AND OF ALL EU ACTIONS.
* THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF MOST CONCERN TO CITIZENS: EMPLOYMENT, 
POVERTY, EQUALITY, CRIME AND DRUGS.

30	WE WILL ARGUE STRONGLY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL BALANCE 
WHICH HAS SERVED THE UNION SO WELL. WE MUST  AVOID ANY TENDENCY TO CREATE A 
'CORE' OF LARGER, MORE POWERFUL STATES AND TO MARGINALISE THE SMALLER MEMBERS. 

31	LABOUR INSISTS THAT THE FUTURE EUROPEAN UNION MUST RETAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL 
CHARACTERISTICS OF EQUALITY OF ALL MEMBER STATES AND INSTITUTIONAL BALANCE, 
INCLUDING THE ROTATING PRESIDENCY. THERE MUST BE NO 'INNER GROUPS' OR 'LARGE 
STATE DIRECTORATE' BASED ON TRENDS SUCH AS FLEXIBILITY. THERE MUST BE NO SECOND-
CLASS MEMBERS.  

32	WE WILL OPPOSE ANY SUGGESTION THAT SMALLER MEMBER STATES SHOULD LOSE THE 
AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO NOMINATE A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION.

33	WE WELCOME THE PROSPECT OF EU ENLARGEMENT FOR THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND 
EASTERN EUROPE. ENLARGEMENT HOLDS OUT THE PROSPECT OF A GENUINELY UNITED EUROPE 
AFTER THE MANY DIVISIONS OF THE PAST CENTURY. HOWEVER, LABOUR ALSO INSISTS THAT 
THE ENTRY TERMS FOR THE LONG LIST OF APPLICANTS MUST BE NEGOTIATED SO AS TO 
PROTECT IRELAND'S LEGITIMATE AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS. ENLARGEMENT 
MUST NOT BECOME AN EXCUSE FOR DILUTION OF THE UNION'S INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES. 
IF PROPERLY PLANNED AND NEGOTIATED IT WILL BRING MANY BENEFITS IN TERMS OF 
SECURITY AND STABILITY AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC ADVANCE IN THE LONG-TERM.

34	WE WILL ALSO SEEK TO DEVELOP AN ENHANCED ROLE FOR THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, 
PARTICULARLY IN STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE CENTRAL AND 
EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  WE WILL BUILD ON IRELAND'S PRESENT LEVEL OF 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL.

CITIZENSHIP & IMMIGRATION

35	LARGE NUMBERS OF IRISH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCED OVER THE YEARS TO LEAVE 
THIS COUNTRY AND SEEK TO BUILD NEW LIVES OVERSEAS. THEIR EXPERIENCE ABOVE ALL 
HAS SHAPED OUR POLICIES UNDER THIS HEADING.

36	WITH  INCREASING POPULATION MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT EUROPE, AND INCREASING 
PROSPERITY IN IRELAND, THIS COUNTRY COULD WELL BECOME A MORE ATTRACTIVE 
DESTINATION FOR NON-NATIONALS SEEKING RESIDENCE AND EMPLOYMENT HERE, AT EVERY 
LEVEL OF THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SCALE.  LABOUR BELIEVES THAT OUR CITIZENSHIP AND 
IMMIGRATION LAWS MUST NOW BE REVIEWED COMPREHENSIVELY. 

37	 WE WILL CONTINUE THE WORK STARTED IN 1992 IN FORMULATING FOR IRELAND A 
PROPER LEGAL FRAMEWORK GOVERNING RIGHTS OF ENTRY, OF RESIDENCE (SHORT AND LONG 
TERM) AND OF ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK FOR CITIZENS OF NON-EU STATES.  
CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT CRITERIA WILL BE SET OUT IN STATUTE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR 
THE EXISTING AD HOC, DISCRETIONARY ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS. THIS LEGISLATION 
WILL REPEAL AND REPLACE THE ALIENS ACT OF 1935.

38	SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATING TO ASYLUM AND THE GRANTING OF REFUGEE STATUS TO 
THOSE ESCAPING PERSECUTION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE REFUGEE ACT WHICH WAS STEERED 
THROUGH THE OIREACHTAS BY JOAN BURTON.

39	WE BELIEVE ALSO THAT THERE IS A STRONG CASE FOR OUR LAWS ON NON-NATIONALS 
TO BE ADMINISTERED BY A SEPARATE IMMIGRATION AUTHORITY.  THE MINISTER AND THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD RETAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERALL POLICY 
DEVELOPMENT, ANALYSIS AND REVIEW AND FOR DECIDING ON ISSUES RELATING TO NATIONAL 
SECURITY.  

40	THE DAY-TO-DAY ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WOULD BE 
DEVOLVED TO THE AUTHORITY, A BODY WHICH WOULD HAVE INDEPENDENT CORPORATE STATUS 
WITH OUTSIDE MEMBERSHIP INCLUDED ON ITS BOARD. THE AUTHORITY WOULD ALSO 
ADMINISTER THE LAW ON NATURALISATION.

41	IT IS IN THE INTERESTS OF BOTH IRELAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT THE 
COMMON TRAVEL AREA SHOULD REMAIN. WE WILL WORK TOWARDS RECONCILING THIS PRIORITY 
WITH THE EMERGING FREEDOMS AND REMOVAL OF REGULATIONS ON TRAVEL AND ACCESS 
INSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION.

A BETTER WAY
 OF DOING
 THINGS

INTRODUCTION

1	OUR OBJECTIVES ARE THESE:

* TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY, 
* TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER PARTICIPATION BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES, 
* TO ENSURE THAT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE IS RESPONSIVE TO 
THE NEEDS OF ALL CITIZENS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE NOT NORMALLY IN A POSITION TO 
ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS. 

2	THIS MEANS THAT THE OPERATION OF OUR CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE UNDER 
CONTINUOUS SCRUTINY. SO SHOULD THE STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC 
SERVICE. THE WAY COURTS ARE RUN, THE WAY THE OIREACHTAS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
PERFORMS - ALL THESE ARE AREAS WHERE WE SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY ASSESSING WHETHER 
CHANGES OR REFORMS ARE DESIRABLE OR NECESSARY.

THE CONSTITUTION

3	THE REPORT OF THE CONSTITUTION REVIEW GROUP AND ITS EXAMINATION BY AN ALL-
PARTY COMMITTEE OF THE OIREACHTAS WILL BE OF CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL AND CIVIC 
IMPORTANCE IN THE LIFETIME OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT.

4	THE FIRST REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE, DEALING WITH THE PRESIDENCY, LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT, THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF BILLS AND THE POSITION OF WOMEN IN THE HOME 
HAS RECENTLY BEEN PUBLISHED. WE SUPPORT MANY OF ITS PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE. 

5	IN PARTICULAR WE SUPPORT, AND WILL PROPOSE FOR ADOPTION BY WAY OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, THE REFORMULATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IN GENDER 
NEUTRAL LANGUAGE (OUR PRESIDENT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY A MAN). 

6	THE OUTDATED REFERENCE IN ARTICLE 41.2 TO WOMAN'S "LIFE WITHIN THE HOME" 
SHOULD BE REPLACED BY A PROVISION ALONG THE FOLLOWING LINES:

"THE STATE RECOGNISES THAT HOME AND FAMILY LIFE GIVES TO SOCIETY A SUPPORT 
WITHOUT WHICH THE COMMON GOOD CANNOT BE ACHIEVED. THE STATE SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO 
SUPPORT PERSONS CARING FOR OTHERS WITHIN THE HOME."

7	OTHER AMENDMENTS, SOME MINOR AND SOME OF SIGNIFICANCE, WILL EMERGE FROM 
THE REVIEW PROCESS. LABOUR WILL PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THIS WORK.

8	THE REVIEW GROUP REPORT RECOMMENDED IN GENERAL AGAINST EXPANDED PROVISIONS 
SETTING OUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS IN A CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT. IT REJECTED 
THE ARGUMENT THAT AT CONSTITUTIONAL LEVEL THE STATE SHOULD GUARANTEE A GENERAL - 
AND LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE - RIGHT TO FREEDOM FROM POVERTY AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION, AS 
A COUNTERWEIGHT TO ECONOMIC INEQUALITY. IT WAS ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE "A 
DISTORTION OF DEMOCRACY TO TRANSFER DECISIONS ON MAJOR ISSUES OF POLICY AND 
PRACTICALITY FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE OIREACHTAS, ELECTED TO REPRESENT THE 
PEOPLE, AND DO THEIR WILL, TO AN UNELECTED JUDICIARY". IN OTHER WORDS, ABSOLUTE 
PERSONAL RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION IN RELATION TO ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL OBJECTIVES 
WOULD LEAVE THE OIREACHTAS WITH NO OPTION BUT TO DISCHARGE THE COST.

9	IN THIS MANIFESTO, LABOUR HAS BEEN ARGUING THE MERITS OF SOCIAL COHESION, 
AND FOR EXPANDING AND WORKING ON THE CONCEPT OF A SOCIAL GUARANTEE. WE BELIEVE 
THAT THE INCLUSION OF SOME SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION IS 
BOTH POLITICALLY PRACTICABLE AND LEGALLY FEASIBLE AND SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY 
FOR WORK BY AN OIREACHTAS COMMITTEE IN THE FUTURE.

10	TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS APPROACH CAN BE TAKEN FROM THE WORK OF THE REVIEW 
GROUP ITSELF. THE FIRST RECOGNISES THE STATUS OF CARERS WITHIN THE HOME AND 
PLEDGES THE STATE TO ENDEAVOUR TO SUPPORT SUCH ACTIVITY. SUCH A PLEDGE, WHICH IS 
SOCIO-ECONOMIC RATHER THAN OF A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS NATURE, WOULD BE 
ENFORCEABLE IN AN APPROPRIATE CASE.

11	THE SECOND EXAMPLE COMES FROM THE REVIEW GROUP'S PROPOSALS TO REPLACE 
ARTICLE 42.4, DEALING WITH FREE PRIMARY EDUCATION. THE GROUP PROPOSES TO EXPAND 
THIS SO AS TO INCLUDE ALSO A RIGHT TO FREE SECONDARY EDUCATION.

12	BOTH THESE EXAMPLES SHOW THAT SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS NEED NOT BE OPEN-ENDED 
OR ROB THE GOVERNMENT AND OIREACHTAS ENTIRELY OF DISCRETION AS TO THE MANNER IN 
WHICH THEY ARE OBSERVED AND VINDICATED. IT IS PRACTICAL, IF THE POLITICAL WILL 
IS THERE, TO RECONCILE TWO ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS: FIRSTLY, TO STATE THE RIGHT 
AND, SECONDLY, TO EXPRESS IT SO AS TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT STATED IN AN 
UNREALISTIC AND ABSOLUTE WAY.

13	LABOUR PROPOSES, THEREFORE, THAT THE SECTION ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN OUR 
CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE EVALUATED CAREFULLY WITH A VIEW TO INCLUDING AN EXPANDED 
LIST OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS. AS WELL AS THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION AND THE 
RIGHTS OF CARERS WITHIN THE HOME, THESE COULD INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE:

_ FREEDOM FROM HUNGER
_ THE RIGHT TO DECENT HOUSING AND HEALTH CARE
_ SOCIAL PROTECTION FOR THE ELDERLY AND OTHERS IN SITUATIONS OF ECONOMIC 
DEPENDENCE. 

14	THERE WOULD BE A CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF A MINIMUM LEVEL OF UNIVERSAL 
ENTITLEMENT TO SUCH RIGHTS, BUT THE RIGHTS WOULD, OF NECESSITY, BE DRAFTED WITH 
QUALIFICATIONS RELATING TO PREVAILING RESOURCES AND STANDARDS.

15	LABOUR AGREES WITH THE REVIEW GROUP THAT, IN ANY PROGRAMME OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE TAKEN TO SPELL OUT EXPLICITLY IN 
THE CONSTITUTION THOSE UNENUMERATED RIGHTS WHICH THE COURTS HAVE DISCOVERED TO 
BE IMPLICIT IN THE TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION AND WHICH THEY SEEK TO PROTECT. 
THESE WOULD INCLUDE:
_ THE RIGHT TO MARRY AND FOUND A FAMILY;
_ THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE STATE;
_ THE RIGHT TO BODILY INTEGRITY;
_ THE RIGHT TO COMMUNICATE;
_ THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO THE COURTS;
_ THE RIGHT TO FAIR PROCEDURES;
_ THE RIGHT TO CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LEGAL AID; AND
_ THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY.

16	WE ALSO SUPPORT THE GROUP'S RECOMMENDATION THAT, IN SEEKING TO IMPROVE AND 
UPDATE THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS ARTICLES OF THE CONSTITUTION, WE SHOULD DRAW 
ON THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS (AND OTHER 
HUMAN RIGHTS CONVENTIONS TO WHICH IRELAND IS A PARTY) WHERE:
_ AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED RIGHT IS NOT EXPRESSLY PROTECTED BY OUR 
CONSTITUTION,
_ THE STANDARD OF PROTECTION OF SUCH A RIGHT IS SUPERIOR TO THAT GUARANTEED BY 
THE CONSTITUTION, OR
_ THE WORDING OF A CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTING SUCH A RIGHT MIGHT BE 
IMPROVED.

17	LABOUR IS FULLY COMMITTED TO REMOVING THE BAN ON REVEALING CABINET 
DISCUSSIONS, IN CLEARLY DEFINED CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS AT 
STAKE.

18	THE QUALIFYING AGE FOR VOTERS IS NOW 18 YEARS. HOWEVER, THE MINIMUM 
QUALIFYING AGE FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE D·IL REMAINS AT 21 YEARS. LABOUR PROPOSES 
THAT THE MINIMUM QUALIFYING AGE FOR BOTH VOTING AND MEMBERSHIP OF THE D·IL 
SHOULD BE SIMILAR, I.E., 18 YEARS.

19	WE WILL OPPOSE A FURTHER CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM ON THE ABORTION ISSUE.

HUMAN RIGHTS

20	THE PROMOTION AND VINDICATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS THE FIRST DUTY OF 
GOVERNMENT.  LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT FULL EFFECT IS GIVEN IN IRISH 
LAW TO INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AGREEMENTS TO WHICH IRELAND IS A PARTY. THESE 
HUMAN RIGHTS AGREEMENTS INCLUDE THE U.N. COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, 
THE COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS AND THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION 
ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS.

21	WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO THE PROGRESSIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF COUNCIL OF 
EUROPE AND UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS WHICH IRELAND HAS NOT YET RATIFIED OR TO 
WHICH WE HAVE ENTERED RESERVATIONS.

22	WE WILL ESTABLISH A INDEPENDENT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WHOSE PRIMARY 
FUNCTION WOULD BE SYSTEMATICALLY TO:
* REVIEW GENERALLY THE COMPLIANCE BY THE STATE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN 
RIGHTS AGREEMENTS TO WHICH IT IS PARTY;
* TO EXAMINE THE MERITS OF INCORPORATING SUCH AGREEMENTS DIRECTLY INTO DOMESTIC 
LAW;
* EXAMINE ANY RESERVATIONS ENTERED BY IRELAND TO SUCH AGREEMENTS AND MAKE 
PROPOSALS FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF SUCH RESERVATIONS WHERE APPROPRIATE;
* EXAMINE AND MAKE PROPOSALS FOR THE RATIFICATION OF, OR ACCESSION TO, 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AGREEMENTS TO WHICH IRELAND IS NOT YET A PARTY;
* EXAMINE AND REPORT AS TO WHETHER THE LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES 
REQUIRED FOR THE CO-ORDINATED IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE BEING PUT IN 
PLACE BY THE OIREACHTAS AND GOVERNMENT.
23	THE COMMISSION WOULD HAVE THE BRIEF OF PROMOTING PUBLIC AND OFFICIAL 
AWARENESS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE STATE'S INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS IN THIS 
AREA. IT WOULD EXAMINE INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINTS WITH A VIEW TO ASSISTING 
COMPLAINANTS IN SECURING THEIR RIGHTS.

ACCESS TO LAW

24	NO MATTER HOW MUCH PROVISION IS MADE FOR SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS, INCLUDING 
EQUALITY OF RIGHTS, THERE REMAIN MANY WHO DO NOT KNOW HOW, OR CANNOT AFFORD, TO 
ASSERT THEM.  AS THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW GROUP POINTED OUT, LACK OF FINANCE, 
INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE AND THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL GAPS WHICH EXIST BETWEEN 
LAWYER AND CLIENT ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNEQUAL TREATMENT SUFFERED BY THOSE 
LIVING IN AREAS OF DISADVANTAGE.  

25	LABOUR IN GOVERNMENT PLACED THE LEGAL AID BOARD ON A PERMANENT STATUTORY 
FOOTING AND A SOUND FINANCIAL BASE. WE ARE COMMITTED TO INCREASING ITS SERVICES.

26	WE WILL ALSO PLACE THE AD HOC SCHEME OF LEGAL AID ADMINISTERED BY THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ON A STATUTORY BASIS AND TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
ITS OPERATIONS TO THE LEGAL AID BOARD.  THE SCHEME IS AT PRESENT AN INFORMAL ONE 
WHEREBY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, ACCORDING TO NO FIXED CRITERIA, MAY UNDERTAKE TO A 
COURT IN ADVANCE TO PAY THE COSTS OF AN IMPECUNIOUS APPLICANT WHO WISHES TO TAKE 
CERTAIN TYPES OF ACTION AGAINST THE STATE IN CIRCUMSTANCES NOT COVERED BY THE 
LEGAL AID ACT. THERE IS NO SET MEANS TEST UNDER WHICH THE SCHEME OPERATES.


27	BUT ACCESS TO LAW MEANS MORE THAN JUST ACCESS TO A LAWYER. IT MEANS THAT 
THE LAW ITSELF - IN THE FORM OF ACTS OF THE OIREACHTAS - MUST BE AVAILABLE, 
REASONABLY COMPREHENSIBLE AND WRITTEN, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, IN PLAIN ENGLISH. 
THERE ARE MANY CASES IN WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT NEED A LAWYER TO FIND OUT WHAT THE 
RULES ARE IN A PARTICULAR AREA. AS MATTERS STAND, IT TAKES MOST LAWYERS 
UNNECESSARY TIME TO TRACK DOWN THE PARENT ACT, THE SEVERAL AMENDING ACTS AND 
THEN THE DOZENS OF STATUTORY INSTRUMENTS MADE UNDER EACH PIECE OF LEGISLATION. 
PRE-1922 STATUTES - MANY OF WHICH ARE STILL IN FORCE IN THE REPUBLIC  - ARE NO 
LONGER EVEN AVAILABLE FOR SALE IN THE GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS SALES OFFICE. 

28	WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF ALL MAJOR AREAS OF LAW (PLANNING, 
FAMILY, SEXUAL OFFENCES, ETC.)  INTO ONE SINGLE STATUTE FOR EACH SUBJECT.  TO 
THAT END, WE WILL RE-ESTABLISH THE POST OF DIRECTOR OF STATUTE LAW REFORM AND 
CONSOLIDATION - A POSITION WHICH HAS LAIN VACANT FOR 20 YEARS. WE WILL CHARGE 
THE DIRECTOR, WITH THE AID OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, WITH THE BASIC TASK OF 
REDUCING THE STATUTE ROLL TO MODERN AND MANAGEABLE PROPORTIONS.

29	WE WILL ALSO COMMISSION THE ADVICE OF THE LAW REFORM COMMISSION ON THE USE 
OF PLAIN LANGUAGE AND SYNTAX IN THE LAW AND WE WILL IMPLEMENT THAT ADVICE.

LETTING IN THE LIGHT

30	FULL ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION IS A KEY FOR ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP. OUR AIM 
IS TO:
_ FURTHER DEVELOP CITIZENS' INFORMATION CENTRES WITH TRAINED STAFF. 
_ PROMOTE AN ACTIVE PUBLIC INFORMATION POLICY, AND ENSURE THE WIDEST POSSIBLE 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION.  
_ USE MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP CITIZENS' INFORMATION ACCESS POINTS THROUGH 
PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND PUBLIC OFFICES.


31	LABOUR SUPPORTS THE CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE D·IL COMMITTEE 
ON SECURITY AND LEGISLATION, SET OUT IN ITS REVIEW OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 
REPORTED IN JANUARY THIS YEAR.  IN PARTICULAR, WE AGREE THAT THE 1963 ACT SHOULD 
BE REPEALED AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE AND REPLACED BY CRIMINAL SANCTIONS 
WHICH APPLY ONLY IN RELATION TO:
_ ESPIONAGE, OR
_ UNAUTHORISED DISCLOSURE OF SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION, THE DISCLOSURE 
OF WHICH IS CALCULATED TO CAUSE SERIOUS HARM TO THE NATIONAL INTEREST.

32	THE LABOUR PARTY IN GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY DELIVERED ON TWO KEY ISSUES - 
ENACTMENT OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LEGISLATION AND THE LIFTING OF THE SECTION 
31 BAN WHICH APPLIED BOTH TO RTE AND TO COMMERCIAL BROADCASTERS.

33	OTHER AREAS FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO ENHANCE CITIZENSHIP AND ACCESS TO 
INFORMATION INCLUDE CONTEMPT OF COURT LAWS, EXTENSION OF THE ARCHIVE ACT TO THE 
WIDER PUBLIC SERVICE, WIDENING THE DATA PROTECTION ACT, BROADENING CITIZEN'S 
RIGHTS OF ACCESS TO THE OMBUDSMAN, AND REMOVING EXEMPTIONS IN THE STATUTORY 
INSTRUMENTS ACT.

34	WE WILL EXAMINE, AS A PACKAGE, THE POSSIBLE INTRODUCTION OF PRIVACY 
PROTECTION LEGISLATION, AND REFORM OF THE LAWS OF DEFAMATION. IN DOING SO WE 
WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE WORK OF THE LAW REFORM COMMISSION AND THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION ON THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY, AS A LINKED PACKAGE 
OF REFORM.

35	LABOUR SUPPORTS GIVING STATUTORY RECOGNITION TO THE JOURNALIST'S DUTY TO 
PROTECT HIS OR HER SOURCES BEFORE A COURT OF LAW - BUT NOT AS AN ABSOLUTE 
ENTITLEMENT. 


	NO OTHER PROFESSION, INCLUDING THE LEGAL PROFESSION, HAS SUCH AN ABSOLUTE 
PRIVILEGE.  WE WOULD SUPPORT THE MINORITY VIEW SET OUT IN A REPORT OF THE LAW 
REFORM COMMISSION ON CONTEMPT OF COURT, WHERE IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT A COURT 
SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO ORDER A WITNESS TO DISCLOSE A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE OF 
INFORMATION - EVEN WHERE SUCH EVIDENCE IS CLEARLY RELEVANT AND ADMISSIBLE - 
UNLESS OBTAINING THAT EVIDENCE IS CLEARLY NECESSARY:

_ TO PREVENT INJUSTICE (SUCH AS, FOR EXAMPLE, TO PREVENT THE CONVICTION OF 
SOMEONE WRONGLY ACCUSED),
_ IN THE INTERESTS OF NATIONAL SECURITY, OR
_ TO PREVENT DISORDER OR CRIME (I.E., WHERE RECEIVING SUCH EVIDENCE WOULD ASSIST 
IN PREVENTING THE COMMISSION OF A FUTURE CRIMINAL OFFENCE).

GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC SERVICE

36	THE PROCESS OF REFORM OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN IRELAND HAS BEEN HUGELY 
ADVANCED IN RECENT YEARS. IN 1993, LABOUR WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN PIONEERING A 
NUMBER OF NEW GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS - EQUALITY & LAW REFORM, ENTERPRISE & 
EMPLOYMENT, ARTS, CULTURE & THE GAELTACHT, AND TOURISM & TRADE. IN THE MAIN, 
THESE INNOVATIONS HAVE WORKED EXTREMELY WELL IN ADVANCING REFORMS, IN PROVIDING 
NEW ENERGY AND FOCUS, AND IN DELIVERING BETTER SERVICES.  

37	AS WELL, KEY LEGISLATION ELEMENTS OF THE REFORM AGENDA ARE EITHER 
COMPLETED OR CLOSE TO COMPLETION; FOR EXAMPLE, THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, 
ETHICS IN PUBLIC OFFICE ACT, PRIVILEGE AND COMPELLABILITY MEASURES TO ENHANCE 
THE WORK OF OIREACHTAS COMMITTEES, AND THE PROPOSALS ON CABINET CONFIDENTIALITY.


38	THE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE (SMI) PROCESS WAS LAUNCHED LAST YEAR. 
ITS BROAD OBJECT IS TO RENEW AND REFORM, WITH THE COOPERATION OF EMPLOYEES AND 
THEIR TRADE UNIONS, THE MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY OF THE PUBLIC 
SERVICE TO ENSURE A BETTER DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC.

39	LABOUR INITIATED MANY OF THESE REFORMS, AND SUPPORTED OTHERS. IN OUR VIEW, 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO VIEW PUBLIC SERVICE REFORMS AS BEING BASED ON CITIZENS' 
ENTITLEMENTS - FOR EXAMPLE, TO QUALITY SERVICE DELIVERY. WE ARE DEALING IN THE 
CASE OF MANY SERVICES WITH CITIZENS' RIGHTS, NOT WITH "CUSTOMERS" OR "CLIENTS" 
AS IN A COMMERCIAL MARKET PLACE. THE UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY OF THE PROVIDERS 
SHOULD REFLECT THIS.

40	WE BELIEVE THAT THERE CAN BE AN IMPROVED ROLE FOR MINISTERS OF STATE.THEIR 
RESPONSIBILITIES MUST BE MADE SPECIFIC, AND  THEIR AUTHORITY MUST  ACCURATELY 
REFLECTS THE SPAN OF THEIR MANDATES - SUCH AS THE MINISTER FOR CHILDREN, FOR 
INSTANCE, WHO WAS APPOINTED IN EDUCATION, HEALTH, AND JUSTICE. 

41	ON THIS BASIS, LABOUR BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A STRONG CASE FOR RE-
DESIGNING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF SOME MINISTERS OF STATE, AND FOR THE 
APPOINTMENT OF OFFICE-HOLDERS (WITHIN THE EXISTING COMPLEMENT), TO ENSURE 
PROGRESS IS MADE IN THE FOLLOWING NEW AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY:

* IMPLENTATION OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORM (SMI)
* OLDER PEOPLE
* PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
* CONSUMERS
* LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM AND RENEWAL.
 
REFORMING THE CIVIL SERVICE

42	MUCH OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR REFORM IS NOW IN PLACE. RADICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL 
CHANGE IN PRINCIPLES, PRACTICES AND CULTURE OF THE WAY PUBLIC BUSINESS IS DONE 
MUST NOW BE REALISED. THE SCALE AND NATURE OF THE CHANGE REQUIRED IS HEAVILY 
DEPENDENT ON STRONG POLITICAL OWNERSHIP. FAILURE BY THE POLITICAL SYSTEM TO 
RECOGNISE AND OWN THIS REFORM PROGRAMME WOULD DAMAGE AND IMPAIR ITS 
IMPLEMENTATION.

43	THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KEY REQUIREMENTS.

44	FIRSTLY, SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGE REQUIRES A STRONG POLITICAL CHAMPION 
TO GENERATE AND SUSTAIN THE SUPPORT. OTHERWISE THE NATURAL INSTINCT OF ANY 
BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM TOWARDS INERTIA, AND ASSISTANCE FROM DIFFERENT INTERESTS, 
WILL COMBINE TO DELAY AND THWART CHANGE.

45	SECONDLY, RESOURCES MUST BE DEVOTED TO MAKING THE CHANGE PROGRAMME COME 
ABOUT. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT POLITICAL COMMITMENT. THE SCALE OF THE 
CHANGES TO BE ADDRESSED WILL REQUIRE POLITICAL CHOICES ABOUT REDEPLOYMENT OF 
RESOURCES. IT WOULD BE UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT CIVIL SERVANTS TO PURSUE A 
DIFFICULT REFORM PROGRAMME IN THE TEETH OF A POLITICAL SYSTEM WEDDED TO AN 
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AGENDA.

46	AN INCREASED EMPHASIS ON HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, AND ENHANCED TRAINING 
ARRANGEMENTS, ARE BOTH ESSENTIAL.  NEW STRUCTURES MAY BE REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH 
THE HUMAN RESOURCES ASPECT OF PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM. THIS WILL HAVE TO BE HANDED 
WITH SENSITIVITY AND CARE IN A SPIRIT OF PARTNERSHIP.

THE DEFENCE FORCES  -  AN AGENDA FOR CHANGE

47	THE LABOUR PARTY RECOGNISES THE VALUABLE AND UNSELFISH SERVICE GIVEN TO 
THE STATE BY MEN AND WOMEN IN THE DEFENCE FORCES AND CIVIL DEFENCE, AND 
ACKNOWLEDGES THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF THE DEFENCE FORCES TO INTERNATIONAL 
PEACE-KEEPING.

48	LABOUR BELIEVES THAT  A WHITE PAPER ON ALL ASPECTS OF DEFENCE AND CIVIL 
DEFENCE, SHOULD BE PREPARED WITHIN ONE YEAR. IT SHOULD SET OUT THE CHALLENGES 
AND ISSUES, INCLUDING MANPOWER AND RECRUITMENT, WHICH FACE THE DEFENCE FORCES 
WELL INTO THE NEXT CENTURY. FOLLOWING THE WHITE PAPER, A COMPREHENSIVE DEFENCE 
BILL WOULD BE DEVELOPED AND PUBLISHED.

49	WE ADVOCATE:

* PLANNED AND ORDERLY RECRUITMENT IN EACH OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WITH AN UPPER 
AGE LIMIT OF 23 AND SPECIAL RECOGNITION FOR SERVICES IN THE FCA/SM.
* THE ENHANCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMISSIONS TO BE AWARDED TO SUITABLE 
NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS, AND ALL PROMOTIONS, WHETHER AT NCO OR OFFICER RANK, 
PERMANENT DEFENCE FORCES OR RESERVE, TO BE FILLED BY COMPETITIVE INTERVIEW.
* A GREATER EMPHASIS, INVOLVING THE DEEPENING OF THE MAJOR CONSULTATION ALREADY 
UNDERWAY ON THE ROLE OF THE RESERVE IN THE WIDER DEFENCE FORCES WITH A FOCUS ON 
FULL TIME PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, ESPECIALLY IN THE FCA AND SLUA MUIRÌ.
* THE UPGRADING OF SELECTED BARRACKS AS TRAINING DEPOTS FOR FORMATIONS UP TO 
BRIGADE LEVEL, FOR BOTH REGULAR AND RESERVE TRAINING.

50	IN ADDITION, LABOUR PROPOSES THAT SERIOUS CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO 
THE ESTABLISHMENT BY STATUTE OF A CIVILIAN INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEFENCE 
FORCES TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE MINISTER AND THE OIREACHTAS ON HOW THE DEFENCE 
FORCES ARE ACHIEVING THEIR MISSION.  THE INSPECTOR GENERAL COULD ALSO ACT AS A 
DEFENCE FORCES OMBUDSMAN IN RELATION TO REDRESS OF WRONGS CASES.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT

51	BRENDAN HOWLIN, SOME MONTHS AGO, ANNOUNCED A WIDE-RANGING PROGRAMME FOR 
REFORM AND RENEWAL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.  SUCH RENEWAL, IF IT IS TO BE REAL AND 
LASTING, MUST COME TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL 
ITSELF: THERE MUST BE SELF-RENEWAL.  

52	LABOUR'S PROGRAMME OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM IS UNDERPINNED BY THE 
FOLLOWING CORE PRINCIPLES.

ENHANCING LOCAL DEMOCRACY BY ENSURING THAT:
_ LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES HAVE A REAL SAY IN THE DELIVERY OF 
THE FULL RANGE OF PUBLIC SERVICES LOCALLY,
_ NEW FORMS OF PARTICIPATION BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE DECISION-MAKING 
PROCESSES  OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE DEVELOPED;
_ A STRENGTHENED ROLE FOR COUNCILLORS IN RUNNING LOCAL COUNCILS EMERGES, AND 
_ DEMARCATION BETWEEN TOWN AND COUNTRY AUTHORITIES ARE BROKEN DOWN.

SERVING LOCAL PEOPLE BETTER THROUGH:
_ A FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF THE CUSTOMER,
_ TIMELY DELIVERY OF SERVICES OF HIGH QUALITY, MEASURED AGAINST PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS, 

_ PERSONNEL TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT IN CUSTOMER CARE,
_ RIGOROUS BUT STREAMLINED OPERATION OF THE VARIOUS REGULATORY CONTROLS, AND
_ MORE OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY IN DECISION-MAKING IN LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

DEVELOPING EFFICIENCY THROUGH:
_ A MODERN AND PROGRESSIVE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WITH AN INCREASED 
EMPHASIS ON COSTING SERVICES,
_ DEVELOPMENT OF PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL INDICATORS AND VALUE FOR MONEY AUDIT, 
_ DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT,
_ DEVELOPMENT OF PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AND BETWEEN 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND OTHER LOCAL ORGANISATIONS, AND
_ EFFECTIVE USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ON A PLANNED BASIS.

53	THE PROCESS OF RENEWAL HAS ALREADY STARTED. LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARGES FOR 
DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED AND THE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED, BY WAY OF MOTOR TAXATION, WITH A SOURCE OF 
REVENUE WITH IN-BUILT BUOYANCY AND LOCAL DISCRETION.

54	FURTHER SPECIFIC STEPS TO BE TAKEN WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
* FORMAL RECOGNITION OF THE STATUS AND FUNCTION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE 
INCORPORATED INTO THE CONSTITUTION.
* LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE REPRESENTED ON THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
COUNCIL.
* DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED COUNCILLORS WILL HAVE AN ENHANCED ROLE:
-	 IN ENSURING THE INTEGRATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH OTHER LOCAL 
DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS AND PUBLIC SERVICES DELIVERED LOCALLY,
- 	IN THE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES BY THEIR COUNCILS, 
THROUGH STRATEGIC POLICY COMMITTEES ON WHICH OUTSIDE LOCAL INTERESTS WILL BE 
REPRESENTED,
- 	BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT GROUPS, 
CONSISTING OF A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ELECTED COUNCILLORS AND REPRESENTATIVES 
DRAWN FROM LOCAL DEVELOPMENT BODIES,
- 	BY THE CREATION OF STRUCTURED CONSULTATION ARRANGEMENTS TO ENSURE GREATER 
LIAISON BETWEEN GARDAÌ AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AND 
- 	BY THE REGULAR ATTENDANCE OF PERSONNEL OF STATE AGENCIES AT LOCAL 
AUTHORITY MEETINGS, TO DISCUSS THE POLICIES BEING PURSUED LOCALLY BY THEIR 
AGENCIES. 

55	THE DUBLIN AND MID-EAST REGIONAL AUTHORITIES WILL BE ASSIGNED A ROLE IN 
DRAWING UP LAND USE PLANNING GUIDELINES FOR THE ENTIRE GREATER DUBLIN AREA, 
WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE RESPECTED BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THAT AREA WHEN 
CONSIDERING DEVELOPMENT PLANS. THIS WILL BE EXTENDED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY AS NECESSARY.

THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC & SOCIAL COUNCIL  AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC & SOCIAL FORUM 

56	THE NESC AND NESF BOTH FULFIL IMPORTANT COMPLEMENTARY ROLES IN THE PROCESS 
OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICY FORMATION, AND IN FOSTERING QUALITY DIALOGUE IN 
THE PARTNERSHIP CONTEXT. THE ROLE OF THE NESF, AS AN INDEPENDENT BODY DEVELOPING 
INNOVATIVE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICY INITIATIVES, WILL BE STRENGTHENED AND 
ENHANCED.

57	FOR THE FUTURE, LABOUR PROPOSES THAT:

* THE TWO ORGANISATIONS SHOULD HAVE JOINT ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH 
CAPACITIES.

* NESF SHOULD SEEK TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR CONSULTATION IN THE REGIONS WITH 
COMMUNITY GROUPS, LOCAL AUTHORITIES, SOCIAL PARTNERS AND OTHERS IN WORKING 
THROUGH ITS PROPOSALS.

* NESF, AS PART OF A REVISED PHYSICAL PLANNING PROCESS, FOLLOWING A PROCESS OF 
CONSULTATION AND RESEARCH SHOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO GOVERNMENT REGARDING 
GROWTH CENTRES FOR THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE.

SUMMARY OF MAIN PROPOSALS
VISION AND CHALLENGES
1	OUR PRORITIES ARE:
PERMANENT PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND BASED ON AN INCLUSIVE SETTLEMENT ROOTED IN 
CONSENT
A WIDER SHARING OF THE BENEFITS OF GROWTH 
AN INTENSIFIED FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY AND LON-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT
EFFECTIVE TACKLING OF CRIME AND OF ITS CAUSES

2	WE HAVE OTHER MAJOR TASKS OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, TAX REFORM, EDUCATION, 
PUBLIC SERVICE REFROM, ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT, CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND 
STRENGTHENING OUR ROLE IN EUROPE AND THE WORLD. AND WE HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINES 
IN KEY AREAS OF SOCIAL REFORM.

3	MAJOR CHALLENGES STILL REMAIN TO BE CONFRONTED:

THE BREAKDOWN OF THE IRA CEASE-FIRE SHATTERED HOPES. IT MEANS THAT EFFORTS MUST 
BE REDOUBLED TOACHIEVE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION

LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS A SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGE THAT DEMANDS 
RADICAL POLICIES.

SERIOUS CRIME DEMANDS STRATEVIES WHICH BALANCE TOUGH MEASURES AGAINST THE 
CRIMINAL, AND TARGETED ACTIONS TO TACKLE THE CAUSES - DRUGS AND POVERTY.

WE WILL BE CAMPAIGNIN IN THIS SELECTION AS PART OF AN OUT-GOING GOVERNMENT. WHEN 
THE ELECTION IS OVER, WE WILL SET DOWN WITH OUR PARTNERS AND NEGOTIATE AN AGREED 
PROGRAMME FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IN THAT SENSE, THIS MANIFEST IS THE SET OF 
PROPOSALS THAT WE WILL BRING TO THOSE NEGOTIATION.

5	WE WANT TO LISTEN. WE FACE A PERIOD OF EXCITING CHANGS, AND MANY 
CHALLENGES. WE ARE SETTING OUT OUR STALL - THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO CONSTRUCT AN 
EVER MORE CONFIDENT, JUST, INCLUSIVE AND TOLERANT IRELAND.

6	AND WE DO IT WITH CNFIDENCE. THAT TRACK RECORD OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS, THE 
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. VISIONS AND CHALLENGES, COMBINED WITH PRACTICAL POLICIES. A 
SLATE OF CANDIDATES THAT IS SECOND TO NONE. DEEP ROOTS IN THE COMMUNITY, AND A 
TOTAL COMMITMENT TO ITS FUTURE. THAT'S LABOUR'S PROMISE.

MANAGING A GROWING ECONOMY

7	WE ARE GOING TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS - ALMOST 
200,000 NET NEW JOBS AND NATIONAL WEALTH UP BE OVER A FIFTH - THROUGH:

PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF THE PUBLIC FINANCES
A PARTNERSHIP APPROACH TO THE ECONOMY AND SOCIAL POLICY
MORE ENTERPRISE, MORE INNOVATON AND MORE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION AND SKILLS 
DEVELOPMENT
A SHARED DISCIPLINE AND FAIRNESS

8	THERE WILL BE NEW CHALLENGES - EMU AND THE RE-NEGOTIATON OF THE STRUCTURAL 
FUNDS

SPENDING AND TAXES

9	 WE NEED TO TACKLE THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY AND SOCIAL DEPRIVATION.  WE 
NEED QUALITY HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES. WE REJECT THE IDEOLOGY THAT PUBLIC 
SPENDING IS TOO HIGH. IN FACT, PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IN IRELAND IS RELATIVELY LOW 
BY EU STANDARDS.

10	OUR APPROACH IS TO SEEK A FAIR BALANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC SPENDING AND WHAT IS 
TAKEN FROM THE PAY PACKET IN TAXES.

11	WE HAVE TO BE PRUDENT
TO PLAN FOR SURPLUSES ON OUR CURRENT BUDGET AS TO PRESENT
TO USE THAT MONEY FOR ESSENTIAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT - IN INFRASTRUCTURE, IN 
SUPPORTS FOR THE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC SECTORS AND IN NECESSARY SOCIAL INVESTMENT 
IN HOUSING, SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS
TO KEEP OUR NATIONAL BORROWING WITHIN LIMITS SUSTAINABLE INSIDE EMU.

SIDE BY SIDE WITH THAT, WE PLAN TO REDUCE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT TAKES IN TAX FROM 
YOUR PAY PACKET: FROM 27P NOW TO 22P FOR THE SINGLE PERSON, AND FROM 20P TO 14P 
FOR THE MARRIED PERSON ON AVERAGE EARNINGS

PEOPLE ON LOW WAGES WILL BENEFIT EVEN MORE- INDEED EVERYONE WILL GAIN FROM 
LABOUR'S TAX PROPOSALS. BEFORE THE END OF 5 YEARS, NO SINGLE PERSON ON THE 
AVERAGE WAGE WILL PAY THE HIGHER RATE OF TAX.

WORK AND ENTERPRISE

12	LABOUR IS THE PARTY OF WORK AND THE PARTY OF ENTERPRISE. WE ADVOCATE:
PRACTICAL MEASURES TO GET TO A NTIONAL MINIMUM WAGE.
STRENGTHENED PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURES AT THE LEVEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL FIRM.
STRONG SUPPORT FOR OUR STATE-SPONSORED COMPANIES AND 'STAKE-HOLDING' FOR 
EMPLOYEES IN THEM THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS AND SHARE-PARICIPATION ACHEMES.
A MAJOR REVIEW OF KEY ASPECTS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR INDUSTRY, TOURISM, AGRICULTURE, SERVICES INDUSTRY, 
FORESTRY, FISHING AND OUR MARINE SECTOR THROUGH PRUDENT USE OF STRUCTURAL FUNDS, 
A GOOD CORPORATION TAX SYSTEM AND APPROPRIATE SUPPORTS FROM STATE AGENCIES WHEN 
NECESSARY.
           
COHESION THROUGH PARTNERSHIP

13
WE FULLY SUPPORT PARTNERSHIP 2000, AND A DETERMINED ATTACK 
AGAINST POVERTY THROUGH THE NATIONAL ANTI-POVERTY STRATEGY. WE 
WILL TACKLE THE MAJOR PROBLEMS OF EDUCATIONAL DISADVANTAGE, 
LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCOME INADEQUACY.

14
AS SPECIFIC MEASURES FOR FAMILIES, AND ESPECIALLY MOTHERS, WE 
AIM TO:

INCREASE CHILD BENEFIT FURTHER FOR MOTHERS, AS WE HAVE IN THE LAST 
FOUR YEARS
INTRODUCE A DOUBLE MONTHLY PAYMENT AT TIMES WHEN NEED WILL 
GENERALLY INCREASE IN AUGUST AND DECEMBER TO CATER FOR 
CHILDREN GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND FOR CHRISTMAS.
SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND CHILD CARE FACILITIES IN THE COMMUNITY, TO A 
NATION-WIDE SERVICE.

SOCIAL GUARANTEE

15
AN ABUNDANT ECONOMY MUST BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE A SOCIETY 
WHERE CHOICES ARE MADE, AND RIGHTS ARE EXERCISED, ON THE BASIS 
OF HOPE AND DIGNITY, AND NOT ON THE BASIS OF DEPENDENCE OR 
CHARITY.

16
IN THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM, WE PROPOSE TO APPLY THE SOCIAL 
GUARANTEE TO THREE GROUPS OF PEOPLE: 
YOUNG PEOPLE FROM 18 TO 21; 
PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY; AND 
PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY

17
OUR OBJECTIVE IS THAT EVERY YOUNG PERSON WILL HAVE A 
WORTHWHILE OFFER OF EDUCATION, TRAINING, CONVENTIONAL 
EMPLOYMENT OR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT. AS PLACES BECOME 
AVAILABLE THIS WILL INVOLVE RAISING THE AGE LIMIT FOR 
UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE.

OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT 100% OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE COMPLETE 
SECOND LEVEL EDUCATION. WHEN THEY DO, THE OPTIONS OPEN TO 
THEM SHOULD INCLUDE

GOING ON TO THIRD LEVEL
TAKING UP TRAINING, TRAINEESHIPS, OR APPRENTICESHIPS
GETTING CONVENTIONAL PAID EMPLOYMENT
TAKING UP SELF-EMPLOYMENT
DOING COMBINED TRAINING/WORK OR 
WORKING IN THEIR COMMUNITY FOR PAY

18
FOR OLDER PEOPLE, A SOCIAL GUARANTEE WOULD AIM TO ENSURE
COUNSELING AND RETIREMENT PREPARATION SERVICES ARE READILY 
AVAILABLE
ACCOMODATION NEEDS ARE FULLY MET
NO ELDERLY PERSON WOULD BE FORCED TO LIVE IN ISOLATION FROM THE 
COMMUNITY
NO ELDERLY PERSON WOULD LIVE IN FEAR, OR BE FORCED TO HIDE 
MODEST ASSETS THROUGH FEAR OF EXCESSIVE CLAW-BACK BY THE STATE
ILLNESS WOULD NOT LEAD TO THE ELIMINATION OF LIFE SAVINGS
RECOVERY FROM ILLNESS WOULD BE SUPPORTED, AT HOME WHEN 
POSSIBLE OR THROUGH DECENT RECUPERATION FACILITIES.
WE ARE PROPOSING THAT A MINISTER OF STATE WOULD BE APPOINTED 
TO THE DEPARTMENTS OF EQUALITY AND LAW REFORM, HEALTH AND 
SOCIAL WELFARE IN THE NEXT GOVERNMENT, WITH SPECIFIC 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR FURTHER DEVELOPING THE SOCIAL GUARANTEE FOR 
OLDER PEOPLE.

19
A SOCIAL GUARANTEE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WOULD SEEK TO 
ENSURE THAT, FROM THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, DIAGNOSIS, OR ONSET OF 
THE DISABILITY, THE FOLLOWING SERVICES WOULD BE GUARANTEED:

DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT
COUNSELING (INCLUDING COUNSELING FOR CARERS WHERE NECESSARY)
A FULL RANGE OF MEDICAL SERVICES AS REQUIRED
EDUCATION AND TRAINING BASED ON THE RIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO 
ASPIRE TO HIS OR HER FULL POTENTIAL, AND TO LIVE AND WORK IN 
MAINSTREAM SOCIETY.
OPEN, SUPPORTED OR SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT AS APPROPRIATE, IN A 
DECENT ENVIRONMENT AND WITHIN REASONABLE ACCESS FROM HOME.
RESIDENTIAL CARE WHEN NEEDED, AND THE GUARANTEE OF A HOME LIFE 
IN PROPER AND SUPPORTIVE SURROUNDINGS.
RESPITE CARE WHEN REQUIRED
ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC TRANSPORT.

20
IN ADDITION, WE WILL ENSURE:
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPORT ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
THAT VICTIMS OF HEPATITIS C ARE PROVIDED WITH A COMPREHENSIVE 
HEALTH CARE PACKAGE AND SUPPORT SERVICES.
THAT GMS SERVICES ARE EXTENDED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO 
YOUNGER CHILDREN
THAT HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS CONTINUE TO BE TACKLED, BY ENSURING 
THAT LEVELS OF INVESTMENT IN THIS INITIATIVE REMAIN A PRIORITY, AND 
BY SETTING OUT MAXIMUM WAITING TIMES FOR DIFFERENT TREATMENTS
THAT THERE WILL BE AN EFFECTIVE DRUG TREATMENT SERVICE WHICH 
WILL OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF OPTIONS TO ADDICTS ACCORDING TO THEIR 
NEEDS. 
THAT THERE WILL BE A GENDER EQUALITY POLICY IN ALL AREA OF 
EDUCATION POLICY, AND THE CONTINUED ENFORCEMENT OF THE GENDER 
BALANCE POLICY FOR STATE BOARDS AND AGENCIES
THAT A CONTINUAL PROGRAMME OF FAMILY LAW REFORM, INCLUDING 
PLACING THE FAMILY MEDIATION SERVICE ON A STATUTORY BASIS, WILL 
REMAIN A PRIORITY
THAT A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF ACTIONS AND SERVICES IN 
RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON THE TRAVELLING 
COMMUNITY IS IMPLEMENTED
THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASED SUPPLY OF HOUSING TO MEET RISING 
DEMAND WITHOUT PLACING UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE ENVIRONMENT
THAT ALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES WILL DRAW UP A FIVE YEAR ENERGY PLAN 
PROVIDING FOR THE IMPROVED INSULATION AND VENTILATION AND FOR 
THE PROVISION OF FULL CENTRAL HEATING IN ALL LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSES

THAT AN OMBUDSMAN FOR CHILDREN WILL BE APPOINTED
THAT A GREEN PAPER ON BASIC INCOME INVOLVING FULL AND OPEN 
CONSULTATION, WILL BE PUBLISHED WITHIN ONE YEAR

A SAFER PLACE TO LIVE

21
CRIME DIVIDES SOCIETIES. IT DAMAGES THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THOSE 
WHO FEEL THREATENED BY IT AND CAN OFTEN MAKE THEM RETREAT FROM 
THE WIDER COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE. TO BE EFFECTIVE, WE 
REQUIRE A TWO PRONGED APPROACH. WE NEED TO DEAL WITH EXISTING 
CRIME IN A RESOLUTE AND DETERMINED FASHION. 

22
BUT, AS IMPORTANTLY, WE NEED TO TACKLE NOW THE CONDITIONS THAT 
CAUSE THE CRIME OF THE FUTURE.

23
THE GARDAI
WE PROPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMISSION ON POLICING TO 
FORGE A MODERN ROLE FOR THE POLICE FORCE. THE COMMISSION 
SHOULD INVOLVE THE GARDAI THEMSELVES, COMMUNITY AND 
VOLUNTARY GROUPS, RESIDENTSÍ GROUPS, APPROPRIATE EXPERTS AND 
OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES. ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE:
THE MERITS OF ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT POLICE AUTHORITY;
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GARDAI, THE OIREACHTAS AND LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES;
INTERNAL GARDA MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES;
THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE 
FORCE;
THE APPROPRIATE FUNCTIONS FOR CIVILIAN STAFF;
THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GARDAI AND OTHER AGENCIES SUCH AS 
CUSTOMS AND REVENUE;
GARDS/COMMUNITY RELATIONS (INCLUDING THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY 
POLICING;
THE ROLE OF SPECIALIST UNITS WITHIN THE GARDAI, AND 
THE POTENTIAL FOR PART-TIME POLICING

24
TACKLING CAUSES OF CRIME
WE ADVOCATE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC POLICIES:
COMMUNITY-BASED SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES IN DISADVANTAGED AREAS, 
SPECIALLY TARGETED AT THOSE FAMILIES WHOSE NEEDS HAVE NOT BEEN 
MET BY THE EDUCATION SYSTEM.
COMMUNITY-BASED HIGH QUALITY PRE-SCHOOL FACILITIES, SIMILARLY 
TARGETED
A REVAMPING OF THE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE SERVICE TO BECOME AN 
EDUCATION WELFARE SERVICE
FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR ATTENDANCE AT POST-LEAVING CERTIFICATE 
COURSES

25
DRUGS
THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS IS BOTH ESSENTIAL FOR THE OVERALL WELFARE 
OF SOCIETY AND A KEY COMPONENT IN THE TASK OF COMBATING AND 
PREVENTING CRIME. THERE ARE THREE KEY ELEMENTS:
POLICIES AIMED AT SUPPLY REDUCTION
POLICIES AIMED AT DEMAND REDUCTION
PROPER TREATMENT FACILITIES
IN REDUCING  THE DEMAND FOR DRUGS, SCHOOL PROGRAMMES, THE 
PROVISION FOR PARENTAL EDUCATION, THE WORK OF COMMUNITY 
DRUGS TEAMS AND TRAINING IN COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP IN 
ENHANCING THE ROLE OF ESTATE MANAGEMENT IN A COMMUNITY BASED 
RESPONSE TO DRUGS ARE ESSENTIAL.

26
THE PROSECUTION OF CRIME
WE PROPOSE AMALGAMATING THE DPPÍS  OFFICE AND THE CHIEF 
STATE SOLICITOR INTO AN EFFICIENT UNIFIED PROSECUTION SERVICE, 
WITH DIRECT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONTACT WITH THE GARDAI
THE PROSECUTION OF DRUGS-RELATED OFFENSES WILL BE FAST-TRACKED 
BY GIVING THEM PRIORITY IN THE PROSECUTION SERVICE. THE 
NECESSARY SUPPORT SERVICES INCLUDING THE GARDA FORENSIC UNIT 
WILL BE UPGRADED.
THE NEED FOR PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF ALL CHARGES IN THE 
DISTRICT COURT SHOULD BE RE-EXAMINED; SOME OFFENCES COULD BE 
DESIGNATED S GOING STRAIGHT TO TRIAL.
THE COURT SYSTEM SHOULD SHARE WITH THE GARDAI AND THE PRISONS 
AN EXTENSIVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FACILITY WHEREBY DETAILED 
INFORMATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON WARRANTS ISSUED, FAILURE TO 
TURN UP FOR TRIAL AND RELATED MATTERS

27
PRISONS
MORE PRISON PLACES ARE NEEDED, BOTH TO ACCOMMODATE 
ADDITIONAL PRISONERS AND TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS
CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DISTRICT 
COURT WITHIN MOUNTJOY ITSELF, TO MINIMIZE TRANSMISSION OF DRUGS.
THE RELEVANT HEALTH BOARD IN EACH CASE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPING HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES WITHIN THE 
PRISONS.
THE CHOICE BETWEEN PRISON AND PAYMENT OF A FINE WILL NOT REST 
WITH THE CONVICTED PERSON; THE APPROPRIATE PENALTY SHOULD BE 
DECIDED BY THE COURTS.
OFFENDERS ASSESSED AS SUITABLE FOR TRANSFERS TO ËOPENÍ PRISONS, 
WHERE THEY WOULD ENJOY A HIGHER RATE OF REEMISSION OF 
SENTENCE, WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO REFUSE TO TAKE UP SUCH A 
TRANSFER IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT, BY REMAINING IN MOUNTJOY, THEY 
ARE LIKELY TO BE RELEASED MUCH SOONER, FOR REASONS OF 
OVERCROWDING
OFFENDERS SHOULD SERVE OUT THEIR SENTENCES IN THE INSTITUTION TO 
WHICH THE AUTHORITIES WISH TO SEND THEM 
WE SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT BY STATUE OF AN INDEPENDENT 
PRISONS AGENCY WITH THE FUNCTION OF MANAGING PRISONS 
COHERENTLY AND IN A PLANNED AND EFFECTIVE MANNER
WE ALSO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR 
OF PRISONS

28
SENTENCING AND PROBATION

WE SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT BY STATUE OF AN INDEPENDENT 
PAROLE BOARD
SENTENCING POLICY AND THE DESIRABLE DURATION OF SENTENCES WILL 
BE URGENTLY ADDRESSED IN A SENTENCING BILL
COMMUNITY SERVICE ORDERS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE GREATEST EXTENT 
POSSIBLE
UNSUPERVISED EARLY RELEASES SHOULD BE ENDED AS QUICKLY AS 
PRACTICAL
THE PROBATION SERVICE SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY TARGET FOR 
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE AREA OF SENTENCING

29
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
LABOUR WILL IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE TASK FORCE 
ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
WE WILL ENSURE THERE IS A PROPER NETWORK OF SERVICES FOR WOMEN 
AND THERE CHILDREN
WE WILL PUT IN PLACE TREATMENT PROGRAMMES FOR MEN WHICH 
CONFRONT THE ROOT CAUSES OF ABUSE
WE WILL ENSURE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL TREAT A VIOLENT ASSAULT ON 
A WOMAN BY SOMEONE SHE KNOWS AS SERIOUSLY AS A VIOLENT 
ATTACK ON HER FROM A STRANGER

30
VICTIMS OF CRIME
A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WILL BE INTRODUCED FOR THE PURPOSE 
OF KEEPING VICTIMS INFORMED AS TO THE STAGE IN THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE PROCESS WHICH THEIR CASE HAS REACHED
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE WORK OF THE IRISH ASSOCIATION FOR 
VICTIM SUPPORT WILL BE ALLOCATED
A COURT ACCOMPANIMENT SERVICE TO PROVIDE ASSURANCE AND 
INFORMATION FOR VICTIMS FACING UNFAMILIAR AND INTIMIDATING 
COURT SURROUNDINGS WILL BE INTRODUCED ON A PILOT BASIS
LABOUR WILL EXAMINE CAREFULLY THE ISSUE OF ENSURING VICTIMS 
RIGHTS TO LEGAL ADVICE OR REPRESENTATION IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS

31
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK
IRELAND IS NOW A BOOMING ECONOMY. THAT MEANS IT IS EVEN MORE 
NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD GIVE INCREASED ATTENTION TO THE QUALITY 
OF LIFE; THE TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT THAT IS EVOLVING; AND THE

OBJECTIVES, WE PROPOSE:

37
THE INFORMATION AGE
WE WILL SET A TARGET OF UNIVERSAL IT LITERACY, AND ACHIEVE IT 
THROUGH:
IMPLEMENTING THE SCHOOLS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 2000 
PROGRAMME THEREBY ACHIEVING A MAJOR LEAP IN THE PROVISION OF 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN OUR SCHOOLS;
TRAINING PROGRAMMES FOR TEACHERS IN THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO USE

38
THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
WE BELIEVE THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS THE KEY TO ELIMINATING 
DISADVANTAGE THROUGHOUT SOCIETY.

AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH

THROUGH THE EDUCATION BOARDS, LABOUR WILL EMPOWER LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE REGIONS. THIS WILL BE A STAGGERING 
CHANGE IN THE WAY EDUCATION IS PLANNED.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND THE EARLY START PRE-

39
IN THE WORLD AND IN EUROPE
THE CORNERSTONES OF OUR APPROACH TO FOREIGN POLICY ARE THESE

WE ADVOCATE A POSITIVE FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON OUR 
MEMBERSHIP OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS

WE WILL UPHOLD IRELANDÍS NEUTRAL STATUS AND WILL NOT SUPPORT 
SEEKING FULL MEMBERSHIP OF THE WEU NOR WILL WE JOIN NATO. 
IRELAND COULD UNDERTAKE CERTAIN TASKS RELATED TO ITS OBSERVER 
STATUS IN WEU AND COULD LEGITIMATELY PARTICIPATE IN THE 
PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE (PFP), ALREADY JOINED BY THE OTHER 
EUROPEAN NEUTRALS. THE PFP IS NOT A MILITARY ALLIANCE AND 
IRELAND WOULD BE FREE TO NEGOTIATE ITS OWN TERMS FOR 
PARTICIPATION.

DISARMAMENT, ENHANCE CONVENTIONAL DISARMAMENT, RID THE WORLD 
OF LANDMINES AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND CURTAIL INTERNATIONAL

WITH LABOUR IN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE 
(ODA) HAS INCREASED FROM £40 MILLION IN 1992 TO £122 MILLION 
OR 0.31% OF GNP IN 1997. WE WILL INCREASE ODA BY 0.05% OF 
GNP EACH YEAR UNTIL THE UN TARGET OF 0.7% OF GNP IS REACHED. 
IRELAND WILL WORK FOR AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO DEAL WITH THE 
DEBT CRISIS OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES.

41
WE WILL WORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENLARGEMENT OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION ALONG LINES DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES 
OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, SECURITY AND STABILITY, THE 
FIGHT AGAINST CRIME AND DRUG ABUSE AND A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME TO 
THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE

42
IRELAND WILL SEEK POLICIES WHICH CAN ACHIEVE HIGH LEVELS OF 
EMPLOYMENT WHILE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS. PROGRESS 
MUST BE MADE TOWARDS A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF EMU AND THE 
REFORM OF THE STRUCTURAL FUNDS MUST BE ACHIEVED IN A BALANCED 
AND EQUITABLE FASHION.

43
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE IGC, LABOUR IS PRESSING FOR:
A SPECIFIC EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER IN THE TREATY
A COMMITMENT TO COMBAT SOCIAL EXCLUSION.
TREATY CHANGES TO FIGHT DISCRIMINATION OF ALL KINDS.
WE WILL SEEK TO ENSURE THAT THE UNIONÍS INSTITUTIONAL BALANCE IS 
MAINTAINED AND THAT EACH MEMBER STATE RETAINS ITS RIGHT TO 
NOMINATE A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION.

44
WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE CREATION OF A NEW AND EFFECTIVE 
REGIME IN IRELAND FOR CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION.

UK AND THE EMERGING SYSTEM OF TRAVEL AND ACCESS WITHIN THE 
EU.

TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY;
TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER PARTICIPATION BY LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES; AND TO ENSURE THAT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND THE 
PUBLIC SERVICE IS RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF ALL CITIZENS, 
INCLUDING  THOSE WHO ARE NOT NORMALLY IN POSITION TO ASSERT THEIR 
RIGHTS.

THE CONSTITUTION
46
WE WILL PROPOSE FOR ADOPTION BY WAY OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
AMENDMENT THE REPLACEMENT OF THE OUTDATED REFERENCE IN 
ARTICLE 41.2 TO WOMANÍS ËLIFE WITHIN THE HOMEÍ WITH THE 
FOLLOWING;
ËTHE STATE RECOGNISES THAT HOME AND FAMILY LIFE GIVES TO SOCIETY 
A SUPPORT WITHOUT WHICH THE COMMON GOOD CANNOT BE ACHIEVED. 
THE STATE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO SUPPORT PERSONS CARING FOR OTHER IN 
THE HOMEÍ
WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO REMOVING THE BAN ON REVEALING 
CABINET DISCUSSIONS, IN CLEARLY DEFINED CIRCUMSTANCES.
THE MINIMUM QUALIFYING AGE FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE DAIL, AT 
PRESENT 21 YEARS, WILL BE REDUCED TO 18 YEARS.
WE WILL OPPOSE A FURTHER CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM ON THE 
ABORTION ISSUE.

47
HUMAN RIGHTS

INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS IN THIS AREA, AND TO EXAMINE

SECURING THEIR RIGHTS.

48
GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SERVICE REFORM
WE SUPPORT THE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE (SMI) PROCESS, 
WHICH WAS LAUNCHED LAST YEAR. ITS BROAD OBJECT IS TO RENEW AND 
REFORM THE MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY OF THE 
PUBLIC SERVICE TO ENSURE A BETTER DELIVERY OF PUBLIC SERVICES

IT IS IMPORTANT TO VIEW PUBLIC SERVICE REFORMS AS BEING BASED ON 
CITIZENSÍ ENTITLEMENTS TO QUALITY SERVICE DELIVERY. WE ARE 
DEALING IN THE CASE OF MANY SERVICES WITH CITIZENSÍ RIGHTS, NOT 
WITH ËCUSTOMERSÍ OR ËCLIENTSÍ, AND THE UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY OF 
THE PROVIDERS SHOULD REFLECT THIS.

49
ENHANCING CITIZENSHIP
LABOUR WILL PROMOTE AN ACTIVE PUBLIC INFORMATION POLICY AND 
WILL ENSURE THE WIDEST POSSIBLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION, USING 
MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP INTERACTIVE INFORMATION ACCESS 
POINTS THROUGH PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND PUBLIC OFFICES.
WE WILL REPEAL THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT. WE WILL OFFER LEGAL 
PROTECTION TO THOSE WHO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON OFFICIAL 
MALPRACTICE.
WE WILL LEGISLATE FOR THE PROTECTION OF JOURNALISTS SOURCES, AND 
REFORM THE LAWS OF DEFAMATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 
ENACTMENT OF A NEW PRIVACY BILL TO PROTECT CITIZENS FROM 
UNWARRANTED INTRUSION INTO THEIR PRIVATE LIVES
WE WILL ALSO EXTEND THE DATA PROTECTION LAWS WHERE APPROPRIATE

50
DEFENCE
WE SUPPORT THE PREPARATION OF A WHITE PAPER DEALING WITH THE 
ISSUES AND CHALLENGES Ñ INCLUDING INVESTMENT AND RECRUITMENT Ñ 
FACING THE MILITARY AND CIVIL DEFENCE FORCES. FOLLOWING THE 
WHITE PAPER, A COMPREHENSIVE AND UP TO DATE DEFENCE BILL 
WOULD BE INTRODUCED
