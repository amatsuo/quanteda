MAKING THE FUTURE WORK


                                  THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT VISION

DEMOCRATIC LEFT IS A SOCIALIST PARTY, WITH THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE THAT NO 
SOCIETY, HOWEVER RICH, CAN LIVE AT EASE IF SOME OF ITS CITIZENS ARE DEPRIVED OF 
THE FRUITS OF PROSPERITY. THIS IS SOCIAL JUSTICE: ALL OF US ARE BORN EQUAL, ALL 
OF US DESERVE AN EQUAL CHANCE. IT IS ALSO COMMON SENSE; ALL OF US WILL BENEFIT 
WHEN EACH OF US IS ABLE TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. THE POVERTY TRAP OF INADEQUATE 
EDUCATION, LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, AND WELFARE DEPENDENCE IS A BITTER 
INHERITANCE PASSED FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
FAMILIES. THIS IS A CRUEL INJUSTICE TO THE VICTIMS, AND A SHAMEFUL WASTE OF 
HUMAN RESOURCES THAT CAN BE PUT TO USE.

NOW, WHEN THE ECONOMY IS DOING SO WELL, IS THE TIME TO DECISIVELY. DEMOCRATIC 
LEFT'S SHORT TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO RELIEVE THE SYMPTOMS OF POVERTY, WITH FURTHER 
IMPROVEMENTS IN SOCIAL WELFARE PROVISION FOR FAMILIES INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT 
RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THE NEXT GOVERNMENT MUST PUT IN PLACE ALL NECESSARY POLICIES 
- FOR EDUCATION, TRAINING AND JOB PROVISION - THAT WILL
ELIMINATE FOR GOOD THE CYCLE OF DEPRIVATION AND EXCLUSION. IN FINALISING THE 
NEXT GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMME WITH OUR PARTNERS, WE WILL INSIST ON A FULL 
COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVING THIS WITHIN TEN YEARS.


MAKING THE FUTURE WORK
POVERTY AMIDST PLENTY

  IRELAND'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE UNDER THE RAINBOW COALITION IS AN OUTSTANDING 
SUCCESS : WE'VE GOT THE FASTEST ECONOMIC GROWTH AMONG THE WORLD'S 26 RICHEST 
COUNTRIES. UNEMPLOYMENT IS FALLING AT LAST, WITH OVER 1,000 PEOPLE FINDING JOBS 
IN IRELAND EACH WEEK. THIS FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE IS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF - 
AND YET IT CANNOT CONCEAL IRELAND'S DEEP-SEATED PROBLEMS OF CHILD POVERTY, 
EXCLUSION AND LONG TERM UNEMPLOYMENT FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

FOUR YEARS AGO, IRELAND HAD ONE OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF POVERTY IN THE EUROPEAN 
UNION. SINCE THEN LARGE INCREASES IN CHILD BENEFIT, INTRODUCED BY PRIONSIAS DE 
ROSSA HAVE IMPROVED SUPPORT FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 
NATIONAL ANTI-POVERTY STRATEGY HAS BEGUN TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. BUT MUCH MORE 
NEEDS TO BE DONE. EVEN THE RELATIVELY WELL OFF AMONG US EXPERIENCE GROWING 
FRUSTRATION AT THE LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, AND THE FAILURE OF PUBLIC 
SERVICES LIKE EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE TO KEEP PACE WITH ECONOMIC PROGRESS. 
DEMOCRATIC LEFT WANTS TO PUT THE ORDINARY DECENCIES OF HUMAN LIFE AT THE CENTRE 
OF POLICY MAKING: - WE WANT PEOPLE TO FLOURISH ALONG WITH THE GROSS NATIONAL 
PRODUCT.


DEMOCRATIC LEFT MANIFESTO

          MAKING THE FUTURE WORK
              WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN...

DEMOCRATIC LEFT HAS ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN GOVERNMENT, FROM 
BRINGING FORWARD GREATLY IMPROVED CHILD BENEFIT, PAYING EQUALITY ARREARS TO 
70,000 MARRIED WOMEN AND FOCUSING EXTRA EDUCATION SPENDING ON SCHOOLS IN 
DEPRIVED AREAS, TO ENDING THE WATER TAX AND MOVING VIGOROUSLY AGAINST ORGANISED 
CRIME. IN PARTICULAR, THIS IS THE FIRST GOVERNMENT TO SERIOUSLY ADDRESS THE 
DRUGS ISSUE, A CAMPAIGN PILOTED BY DEMOCRATIC LEFT.

WE KEPT OUR PROMISES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF PRUDENT STATE SPENDING, AND A 
PARTNERSHIP APPROACH ON THE ECONOMY, DEMOCRATIC LEFT REINFORCED THE HUMAN 
DIMENSION OF THE RAINBOW
GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMME.

 BUT WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN. A FULL 5-YEAR TERM TO IMPLEMENT A COMMON PLATFORM 
WITH FINE GAEL AND LABOUR WILL MAKE A REAL IMPACT ON POVERTY, BEING TO THE TAX-
SYSTEM, AND APPLY SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH TO IMPROVING 
EVERYONE'S QUALITY OF
LIFE. GIVEN ANOTHER STRONG VOICE IN THE DAIL, AND INGOVERNMENT, DEMOCRATIC LEFT 
WILL BE A GUARANTOR THATTHE SOCIAL POLICY PRIORITIES ARE ADDRESSED URGENTLY, AND 
WILL PREVENT ANY SELFISH DISSIPATION OF IRELAND'SUNIQUE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. IN 
THIS ELECTION, DEMOCRATIC LEFT IS PROPOSING PRACTICAL POLICIES WILL
GOVERNMENT'S IN CRUCIAL AREAS. OUR SOCIAL LISTS OFDEMANDS SET AMBITIOUS POLICY 
OBJECTIVES THAT CAN BEACHIEVED WITHIN 5 YEARS - A FULL TERM OF OFFICE. ANDJUST 
AS WE HAVE DONE SO FAR, WE WILL KEEP OUR PROMISES.






JOBS

DESPITE RECENT UNPRECEDENTED PROGRESS ON JOB CREATION, UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL 
MUCH TOO HIGH. WE ARE CURRENTLY CREATING 1,000 JOBS EACH WEEK, AND HAVE THE 
POLICIES TO CONTINUE DOING SO. THE SPECIFIC MEASURES SET OUT IN DEMOCRATIC 
LEFT'S "PASSPORT TO WORK" PROGRAMME INCLUDE: 

A GUARANTEED OFFER OF A JOB, TRAINING OR EDUCATION FOR EVERY PERSON WHO IS LONG 
TERM UNEMPLOYED. BETTER CO-ORDINATION OF EXISTING SERVICES.  MAINTENANCE OF A 
HIGH LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IDENTIFICATION AND DIRECTION 
OF INVESTMENT TO
INDUSTRIAL GROWTH SECTORS IN THE FUTURE. 


FAIR TAXES

THERE ARE STILL SERIOUS INEQUITIES IN THE IRISH TAX SYSTEM. PEOPLE ON LOW 
INCOMES STILL PAY TOO MUCH TAX. SO DO MIDDLE INCOME EARNERS. YET MANY TAX BREAKS 
ARE AVAILABLE TO THE VERY RICH WHO CAN AFFORD TO PUT MONEY INTO VARIOUS 
INVESTMENT SCHEMES. THE FRUITS OF A PROSPERING ECONOMY SHOULD INCLUDE IMPROVED 
PUBLIC SERVICES AND LOWER TAXES FAIRLY DISTRIBUTED. 
TAX REDUCTION WILL BE FOCUSED MAINLY ON LOW INCOMES AND MIDDLE EARNERS. BUT, ALL 
TAXPAYERS WILL BENEFIT. 

NOBODY WILL PAY TAX ON THE FIRST £100 P.W.OF INCOME. (£200 P.W. FOR COUPLES). 
TAX LOOPHOLES FOR THE WEALTHY WILL BE CLOSED. 

THERE WILL BE NO TOLERANCE FOR BIG TAX EVADERS AND JAIL SENTENCES FOR EVASION. 
REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF CORPORATION TAX MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY ANTI-AVOIDANCE 
AND CLAWBACK MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THE OVERALL TAX CONTRIBUTION OF THE 
CORPORATE SECTOR IS KEPT AT A FAIR LEVEL.


INCOMES

OUR TAX AND WELFARE SYSTEMS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO GUARANTEE FINANCIAL SECURITY 
AND FAIRNESS. THE NATIONAL ANTI-POVERTY
STRATEGY INITIATED BY DEMOCRATIC LEFT IN THIS GOVERNMENT HAS
BEGUN THE WAR IN POVERTY. DEMOCRATIC LEFT IN GOVERNMENT WILL INSIST THAT THERE 
IS NO LET UP IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION. 
OUR MAIN POLICY OBJECTIVES ARE: 

A MINIMUM WAGE FOR THOSE AT WORK. 

AN ADEQUATE MINIMUM INCOME FOR ALL CITIZENS. 

NO TAX ON THE FIRST £100 P.W. OF INCOME. 

FURTHER HARMONISATION OF THE TAX AND WELFARE SYSTEMS TO MAKE THEM MORE WORK-
FRIENDLY. 

IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH STATE AND OCCUPATIONAL PENSIONS. 

PHASING OUT THE HEALTH AND EMPLOYMENT LEVIES (CURRENTLY 2.25%). 



CRIME
TACKLING CRIME AND ITS CAUSES MUST CONTINUE AS ATOP PRIORITY. THERE MUST BE NO 
LET-UP IN THE PURSUIT AND CONVICTION OF CRIMINALS. EQUALLY, GOVERNMENT MUST 
TACKLE THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME.
IN GOVERNMENT WE WOULD SEEK:
* FURTHER MODERNISATION AND MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE POLICE SERVICE AT LOCAL 
LEVEL.

* INTRODUCTION OF STATUTORY GARDA LIAISON COMMITTEES IN EVERY LOCAL AUTHORITY 
AREA.
* IMPROVED COURT EFFICIENCY TO SPEED UP THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.

* COMPLETION OF THE PRISON BUILDING PROGRAMME.

* INVESTMENT IN KEEPING FIRST OFFENDERS OUT OFPRISON.

* TACKLING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN THROUGH PROVISION OF MORE REFUGES AND AN ANTI-
VIOLENCE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME IN SCHOOL AND PRISONS.

DRUGS

  DEMOCRATIC LEFT HAS LED THE MOST SUSTAINED ATTACK ON DRUGS EVER, THIS YEAR 
SECURING £34 MILLION, PLUS THE SEIZED ASSETS ON THE DRUG BARONS TO SUPPORT 
COMMUNITIES WITH TREATMENT, EDUCATIONAL, REHABILITATION AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES. 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LOCAL DRUGS TASK FORCES INVOLVING REPRESENTATIVES ON THE 
COMMUNITY AND VOLUNTARY SECTORS HAS TRANSFORMED THIS STRUGGLE. WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO WORK EFFECTIVELY TO DRIVE DRUGS OUT OF OUR COMMUNITY. 
OUR POLICY PRIORITIES WILL INVOLVE : 
CLAMPING DOWN ON THE SMUGGLERS AND ORGANISERS OF THE DRUG TRADE. 

SEIZING THE ASSETS OF DRUG BARONS THROUGH THE CRIMINAL ASSETS BUREAU. 

HELPING ADDICTS AS WE WOULD THE VICTIMS OF ANY SERIOUS HEALTH EPIDEMIC. 

PROVISION OF SPORTS AND LEISURE FACILITIES TO TURN YOUNG PEOPLE AWAY FROM DRUGS. 

CONCENTRATION ON EDUCATION, PUBLIC INFORMATION AND HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES. 

THE INFORMATION SOCIETY
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS CREATING NEW WEALTH, NEW GROWTH, NEW JOBS AND NEW 
OPPORTUNITIES. IN IRELAND WE ARE CREATING A THOUSAND NEW JOBS EVERY WEEK.
LEAVING IT ALL SIMPLY TO MARKET FORCES - THE RIGHT-WING APPROACH - WILL RESULT 
IN IMPOVERISHMENT FOR MANY. THE INFORMATION SOCIETY - THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL MARKET 
APPROACH OF THIS GOVERNMENT - IS THE POLITICAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE OPPOSITION'S 
POLITICS OF SELFISHNESS AND GREED.
WE SUPPORT :
* A MAJOR PROJECT FOR IRISH SCHOOLS TO PROMOTE FAMILIARISATION WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.
* A COMPUTER FOR EVERY 10 CHILDREN IN PRIMARY SCHOOL.
* ALL SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES TO BE CONNECTED FREE TO THE INTERNET.

THE FOOD INDUSTRY
DEMOCRATIC LEFT BELIEVES THAT THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE 
FOOD INDUSTRY IN ALL ITS COMPONENT PARTS DELIVERS TO THE CONSUMER SAFE 
NUTRITIOUS AND QUALITY FOOD. THIS WOULD BE
DONE BY THE CREATION OF A STATUTORY QUALITY ASSURANCE SCHEME. REGISTRATION WITH 
THE SCHEME WOULD BE A PRE-CONDITION TO PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF FOOD 
PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. THIS IS WHAT IS MEANT BY AN INTEGRATED "STABLE 
TO TABLE" POLICY.

THE CORNERSTONE OF SUCH A SCHEME WOULD BE ISO STANDARD QUALITY SURVEILLANCE 
UNDERPINNED BY INDEPENDENT CERTIFICATION INCLUDING, WHERE APPROPRIATE, 
VETERINARY CERTIFICATION. THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THE CONFIDENCE OF BOTH DOMESTIC 
AND OVERSEAS CONSUMERS IN STANDARDS OF IRISH FOOD PRODUCTION.
OUR POLICY THEREFORE WOULD BE :
* TO TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOOD INDUSTRY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF 
ENTERPRISE AND EMPLOYMENT, BUT WITH AN INDEPENDENT VETERINARY AND FOOD 
INSPECTORATE.
* THE CREATION OF A NATIONAL QUALITY ASSURANCE SCHEME WITH A LEGISLATIVE AND 
MANDATORY BASIS FOR ITS KEY PROVISIONS AND ADDITIONAL VOLUNTARY CODES OF 
PRACTICE.
* COMPUTERISATION OF THE NATIONAL HERD.
* THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL DISEASE SURVEILLANCE CENTRE FOR ZOONOSES AND 
FOOD BORN DISEASES.
 
CARING FOR ALL
OUR SOCIETY WILL BE JUDGED BY HOW WELL WE TREAT THOSE WHO NEED OUR CARE AND 
SUPPORT.  DEMOCRATIC LEFT WILL FOCUS ON CHILDREN, THE
 ELDERLY, FAMILIES WITH LOW INCOMES AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE HAVE SHOWN 
THE PRIORITY WE ATTACH TO CHILD CARE WITH UNPRECEDENTED INCREASES IN CHILD 
BENEFIT AND WOULD CONTINUE PRIONSIAS DE ROSSA'S REFORMS BENEFITING MOTHERS AND 
CHILDREN.
A CARING SOCIETY SHOULD ELIMINATE ANY ANXIETY ABOUT BEING CARED FOR IN OLD AGE 
OR IN CHILDHOOD.
SIMILARLY THERE SHOULD BE A GUARANTEE OF ADEQUATE LEVELS OF CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH 
A MENTAL OR PHYSICAL DISABILITY.
THEREFORE WE PROPOSE :
* THE INTRODUCTION OF A QUALITY ASSURANCE SCHEME IN THE HEALTH SERVICE, 
INCLUDING THE BTSB.
* A DOUBLING OF THE INCOME THRESHOLDS AT WHICH OLD AGE PENSIONERS QUALIFY FOR A 
MEDICAL CARD AND THE SAME FOR CHILDREN UNDER SEVEN.
* IMPROVED TAX AND WELFARE TREATMENT FOR PENSIONERS AND CARERS.
* GUARANTEED RESIDENTIAL DAY OR RESPITE SERVICES FOR THOSE WITH A MENTAL OR 
PHYSICAL DISABILITY.
* THE INTRODUCTION OF A CARER'S BENEFIT, BASED ON PRSI CONTRIBUTIONS.
* CHILD BENEFIT TO BE DOUBLED OVER THE NEXT FIVEYEARS.
* DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL WELFARE TO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A CHILD 
CARE PROGRAMME AND FOR CO-ORDINATING THE WORK OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS.

EDUCATION

NO ONE SHOULD BE ILLITERATE IN THE INFORMATION AGE. EACH SCHOOL SHOULD CONTRACT 
WITH PARENTS TO GUARANTEE FUNCTIONAL LITERACY AND NUMERACY STANDARDS ON LEAVING 
PRIMARY SCHOOL, AND SHOULD BE RESOURCED TO MEET THIS COMMITMENT.
OUR PROPOSALS INCLUDE :
* COMPREHENSIVE PRE-SCHOOL PROVISION WITH AN INITIAL "EARLY START" PRE-SCHOOL 
PROJECT FOR EVERY PRIMARY SCHOOL DESIGNATED DISADVANTAGED.
* PHASED INTRODUCTION OF GRANT ASSISTANCE TO PLC STUDENTS.
* EQUALITY OF ACCESS TO CONTINUING EDUCATION THROUGHOUT ADULT LIFE.
* THE ADULT LITERACY & COMMUNITY EDUCATION BUDGET TO BE DOUBLED.
* CLASSROOM ASSISTANTS FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES.
* DOUBLING THE CAPITATION GRANT TO PRIMARY SCHOOLS OVER FIVE YEARS.

THE ENVIRONMENT

SAFE FOOD, CLEAN WATER, FRESH AIR AND CLEAN STREETS ! THE NEXT GOVERNMENT MUST 
CARRY OUT AN ASSESSMENT OF TRANSPORT, FARMING, WASTE, ENERGY AND INDUSTRY TO 
ENSURE THAT ALL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
  ENHANCES RATHER THAN HARMS THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS A MATTER OF IMPROVING THE 
QUALITY OF CITIZEN'S LIVES AS WELL AS HANDING AN UNDAMAGED PLANET TO FUTURE 
GENERATIONS. WE WANT TO SEE THE APPLICATION OF ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES TO ALL 
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. OUR PROPOSALS INCLUDE :
* INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT, INCLUDING ACCESS FOR PEOPLE 
WITH DISABILITIES.
* PROPER ENFORCEMENT OF TRAFFIC RULES AND RE-ASSESSMENT OF PARKING POLICIES.
* REVISED PLANNING PROCEDURES TO PROTECT THE
PUBLIC INTEREST IN BALANCED DEVELOPMENT.
* CONTINUATION OF EFFORTS TO CLOSE DOWN SELLAFIELD AND END THE NUCLEAR THREAT.

HOUSING AND PLANNING

HOUSING

HOUSING IS AN ESSENTIAL HUMAN REQUIREMENT. IT FRAMES OUR LIVES AND SHAPES OUR 
COMMUNITIES FOR GOOD OR ILL. OUR AIM IS TO ENSURE GOOD QUALITY, SUSTAINABLE 
HOUSING BY MAINTAINING SOCIAL HOUSING AT ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF 7,000 HOUSING 
STARTS EACH YEAR. OVERALL, THE RECORD LEVEL OF HOUSE-BUILDING IN IRELAND FAR 
EXCEEDS THAT OF ANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRY. THE ESRI ESTIMATES THAT 31,000 
HOUSES ARE NEEDED FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2001. PROJECTED FIGURES INDICATE WE WILL 
BUILD 35,000 IN 1997.

GREATER EMPHASIS MUST BE PUT ON SUSTAINABILITY - BUILDING WITHIN CITIES AND 
TOWNS, REVIEWING DERELICT AREAS AND HIGHER DENSITIES WHERE REQUIRED. SIMPLE 
REZONING OUTWARDS FROM DUBLIN IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION.

WE WOULD REDUCE THE COST OF HOUSING BY EXPANDING THE SOCIAL & CO-OPERATIVE 
HOUSING PROGRAMME, MORE HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT CLOSE TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
ROUTES AND A NATIONAL SETTLEMENT STRATEGY TO REDUCE PRESSURE ON THE DUBLIN AREA.


HOUSING AND PLANNING

HOUSING 

AN APPROPRIATE RANGE OF MEASURES TO ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST THOSE ON LOCAL WAITING 
LISTS TO SECURE THEIR OWN ACCOMMODATION INCLUDING : 

IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY UNDER THE SHARED OWNERSHIP SCHEME. 

A SYSTEM OF "LOW START" MORTGAGES INVOLVING AN INTEREST RATE SUBSIDY. THIS COULD 
BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO, OR REPLACE, THE MORTGAGE ALLOWANCE SCHEME. 

SWA RENT SUPPLEMENTATION TO ENABLE PERSONS IN LOW PAID EMPLOYMENT TO OBTAIN 
ACCOMMODATION IN THE PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR. 


HOUSING AND
PLANNING

HOUSING 

A TARGETED HOME IMPROVEMENT GRANT SCHEME LIMITED TO ESSENTIAL WORKS REPLACEMENT 
AND INSULATION. 

A WHITE PAPER ON HOUSING POLICY IN THE 21ST CENTURY. 

STRICT MONITORING OF LENDING AGENCIES TO ENSURE PROPER LENDING PRACTICES. 

A NEW PROGRAMME TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 10 YEARS TO ENSURE THAT ALL LOCAL 
AUTHORITY HOUSES, THAT NEED IT, ARE PROVIDED WITH
 CENTRAL HEATING, WINDOW REPLACEMENT AND INSULATION. 

THE EXTENSION OF TENANT PARTICIPATION IN GOOD ESTATE MANAGEMENT AS WIDELY AS 
POSSIBLE. 

A 56% TAX ON WINDFALL PROFITS FROM LAND RE-ZONING. 


                                       HOUSING AND PLANNING

PLANNING 

THERE SHOULD BE A NATIONAL LAND USE PLAN WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR 
BALANCED PLANNING. REGIONAL AUTHORITIES WOULD DRAW UP THEIR GUIDELINES IN 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE NATIONAL PLAN. THE PREPARATION OF COUNTY DEVELOPMENT PLANS 
TO BE REFORMED IN ORDER TO ENSURE: 

-GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY, 

-IMPROVED PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION 

-INTEGRATION OF LOCAL STRATEGIC AREA PLANS. 

YOUNG PEOPLE
            TOMORROW MATTERS

ONE OF THE MARKS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS IS HOW EACH GENERATION CREATES A PLATFORM 
FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE NEXT. WE WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO KNOW THATTHEIR WELFARE 
IS IMPORTANT AND THAT THEIR NEEDS WILL BE ADDRESSED.
THROUGHOUT THIS MANIFESTO IS A SERIES OF SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS INTENDED TO ENSURE 
THAT YOUNG IRISH PEOPLE GROW AND PROSPER IN A SOCIETY WHICH IS SAFE, CARING AND 
FAIR.
IN ADDITION WE PROPOSE :
* INCREASING PLACES TO YOUTHREACH PROGRAMME.
* INCREASING SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING AT HOME.
* TAX INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT THE BUILDING OF A 50 METRE POOL IN DUBLIN AND THE 
BUILDING OF A NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE.

PEACE AND RESPONSIBILITY
WE WANT AN IRELAND AT PEACE WITH ITSELF AND THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH A SENSE 
OF RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS PEOPLE LESS FORTUNATE AND PROSPEROUS THAN OURSELVES. A 
GREATER CONTRIBUTION IS NEEDED TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT AID FOR OTHERS. WE WANT TO 
SEE : 
* CONTINUED PRESSURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF "SOCIAL EUROPE".
* DISARMAMENT AND THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT UNDER UNITED 
NATIONS MANDATES.
* CONTINUED INCREASE IN ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO DEVELOPMENT AID.

* SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF OUR OWN LONG-RUNNING CONFLICT IN NORTHERN IRELAND BY 
INSISTING ON AN END TO VIOLENCE; PROMOTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INCLUSIVE, 
DEMOCRATIC POLICIES AND A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT BASED ON CONSENT.
* CONTINUED NON-MEMBERSHIP OF NATO AND PFP.


MAKE THE FUTURE WORK

THESE ARE INTELLIGENT, COMMON SENSE POLICIES. THEY ARE RADICAL, BECAUSE THEY ARE 
DESIGNED TO END, NOT JUST EASE, OUR PROBLEMS OF PERSISTENT POVERTY, 
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, INEQUALITY AND
 INJUSTICE. DEMOCRATIC LEFT OFFERS PRACTICAL STEPS TOWARDS A SOCIETY IN WHICH 
PROBLEMS ARE NOT BOUGHT OFF AT GREAT EXPENSE, BUT SOLVED, TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL.
