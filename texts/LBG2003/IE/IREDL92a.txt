
GENERAL ELECTION, NOVEMBER 1992

A PROGRAMME FOR CHANGE AND PROGRESS

DEMOCRATIC LEFT

INTRODUCTION

THE COLLAPSE OF THE FIANNA FAIL/PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT COALITION 
BROUGHT AN END TO A GOVERNMENT OF FAILURE. A GOVERNMENT WHICH 
ADDED OVER 70,000 PEOPLE TO THE DOLE QUEUES. A GOVERNMENT 
WHICH LACKED EITHER THE VISION OR THE COURAGE TO TACKLE OUR SOCIAL 
AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. 
DEMOCRATIC LEFT IS IRELAND'S NEWEST POLITICAL PARTY. A PARTY 
WHICH COMBINES RADICAL POLITICS WITH DEMOCRATIC ACTION. A THORN 
IN THE SIDE OF A SMUG POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT. A BEACON OF HOPE 
FOR THE FUTURE. 
DEMOCRATIC LEFT WORKS WITH PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES ALL OVER 
IRELAND. WE UNDERSTAND THEIR PROBLEMS AND SHARE THEIR HOPES AND 
ASPIRATIONS. 
IN RAISING THE PROBLEMS OF THE PEOPLE WE CAUSED PROBLEMS FOR THE 
ESTABLISHMENT. THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT. TOO BAD. BECAUSE WE'LL BE 
BACK IN THE NEXT DAIL TALKING ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES THAT CONCERN 
PEOPLE. ISSUES LIKE JOBS, HOUSING, SOCIAL WELFARE CUTS, HEALTH, 
EDUCATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT. 
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SET THE AGENDA FOR CHANGE. WE STAND FOR 
AN OPEN, TOLERANT SOCIETY, BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF ALL CITIZENS. 
FOR PEACE AND RECONCILIATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND. FOR A UNITED, 
DEMOCRATIC EUROPE. FOR A WORLD FREE OF WARS AND A THIRD WORLD 
FREE OF FAMINE. 
AFTER THE ELECTION WE WILL NOT BE SCRAMBLING FOR CABINET SEATS. 
OUR PRIORITIES ARE HOUSES FOR THE HOMELESS, JOBS FOR THE 
UNEMPLOYED, A JUST SYSTEM OF SOCIAL WELFARE, A FAIR DEAL FOR 
PAYE WORKERS AND A BETTER EDUCATION FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN. 

JOBS

AS A SMALL, OPEN ECONOMY, IRELAND IS SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENTS - THE FALL IN STERLING THE US RECESSION, UNCERTAINTY 
IN THE EUROPEAN MONEY MARKETS, LOW LEVELS OF WORLD TRADE. 
HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE HELPLESS IN THE FACE OF 
INCREASING LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT. IT SIMPLY DICTATES THE TYPE OF 
STRATEGIES AND INSTRUMENTS WHICH WE USE TO REDUCE 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY. WHILE WE MUST SEEK CO-OPERATION AT 
THE EC AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO COMBAT COMMON OBSTACLES TO 
FULL EMPLOYMENT, WE MUST BEGIN THE WORK HERE AND NOT WAIT FOR 
OUTSIDE AGENCIES TO BAIL US OUT. 
ENDING UNEMPLOYMENT IS PRIMARILY ABOUT CREATING VIABLE NEW 
JOBS. THE CHANGES WHICH ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO GET IRISH SOCIETY 
BACK TO WORK CAN BE BROUGHT ABOUT IF TWO VITAL INGREDIENTS CAN BE 
COMBINED: POLITICAL WILL AND PEOPLE'S INVOLVEMENT. THIS IN TURN 
REQUIRES THE ABANDONMENT OF THE FAILED IDEOLOGY OF THATCHERISM 
AND THE ADOPTION OF AN ACTIVE ROLE BY THE STATE IN JOB CREATION. IT 
FURTHER REQUIRES THE INTRODUCTION OF REAL INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY 
WHEREBY PEOPLE'S COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE CAN BE HARNESSED AND 
DEVELOPED THROUGH NEW AND BETTER FORMS OF WORK ORGANISATION, 
FULL DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL AND CORPORATE INFORMATION, AND 
EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING. 
ANY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF JOB CREATION MUST ALSO EXTEND TO 
CONSIDERATION OF THE KIND OF TAX AND SOCIAL WELFARE REFORM 
SUGGESTED ELSEWHERE BY US. IT MUST LOOK AT PERSONAL TAXATION AND 
INCOME SUPPORT, AS WELL AS COMPANY TAXATION, GRANTS, SUBSIDIES 
AND OTHER INCENTIVES. 
OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO HARNESS MARKET FORCES ON BEHALF OF ORDINARY 
PEOPLE - WORKERS AND CONSUMERS - AND USE THEM FOR THE GREATER 
GOOD OF SOCIETY. THIS ALSO REQUIRES SOCIAL OWNERSHIP, IN VARIOUS 
FORMS, OF MANY OF SOCIETY'S RESOURCES, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE 
CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH, POWER AND PRIVILEGE IN THE HANDS OF A 
SMALL ELITE. 

OUR JOBS PROGRAMME CAN BE SUMMARISED AS FOLLOWS: 
REINVESTMENT: PROFITS MADE IN IRELAND MUST BE REINVESTED IN 
IRELAND. THE AIM IS TO INCREASE INVESTMENT IN JOB CREATION. 
MAJOR PROJECTS: EXTENSIVE URBAN RENEWAL IS URGENTLY NEEDED. SO 
TOO ARE RAPID RAIL, HOUSE BUILDING, MAJOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO 
CREATE NEW FACILITIES FOR OUR CITIZENS, AND INCREASES IN TOURISM 
AND RELATED SERVICES. 
EC INDUSTRIAL POLICY: AN EFFECTIVE EC INDUSTRIAL POLICY WHICH 
DECENTRALISES INVESTMENT, INDUSTRY AND SERVICES IS VITAL. IT MUST 
PROTECT THE PERIPHERAL REGIONS AND LOCATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WHERE 
PEOPLE ARE AVAILABLE FOR WORK. 
NEW WAYS OF WORKING: IRISH COMPANIES MUST BE DEMOCRATISED 
TO GIVE WORKERS AND CONSUMERS GREATER INFLUENCE. THERE MUST BE 
NEW WAYS OF WORKING, GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCREASED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERYONE AT WORK. 
LOCAL INDUSTRY: STATE RESOURCES MUST BE FOCUSED ON INDIGENOUS 
INDUSTRY. WE NEED COMPANIES WHICH WILL FORM A STRONG 
INDUSTRIAL BASE WITH MAXIMUM LOCAL INVOLVEMENT AND 
COMMITMENT TO DEVELOPING THE IRISH ECONOMY. 
PUBLIC SECTOR: REVITALISATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR COMPANIES IS 
REQUIRED AND AN END TO PRIVATISATION AND RESTRICTIONS ON 
INVESTMENT. APPROPRIATE SUPPORT MUST BE GIVEN TO ALL 
EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, AND CORRUPT BUSINESS 
PRACTICES MUST BE ROOTED OUT. 
COMMUNITY JOBS PROGRAMME: IN THE SHORT TERM, DEMOCRATIC LEFT 
PROPOSES A COMMUNITY JOBS PROGRAMME, TO BE OPERATED THROUGH 
LOCAL 'PARTNERSHIP SCHEMES' UNDER THE PESP. SUCH SCHEMES 
ALREADY HAVE BUILT-IN TRADE UNION, EMPLOYER AND COMMUNITY 
PARTICIPATION. 

THE COMMUNITY JOBS PROGRAMME WOULD

-CREATE 50,000 JOBS, 25,000 FULL-TIME AND 25,000 PART-TIME. 
THESE JOBS WOULD LAST FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND WOULD BE 
CONFINED TO THE PUBLIC AND VOLUNTARY SECTORS.

-INVOLVE A STRONG TRAINING AND EDUCATION ELEMENT, INCLUDING BOTH 
ON AND OFF THE JOB TRAINING.

-GIVE PRIORITY TO JOB CREATION WHICH HAS LONG-TERM ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL, WHICH SEEKS TO ESTABLISH NEW SERVICES OR 
IMPROVE EXISTING SERVICES. JOBS WOULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED IN 
COMPETITION WITH OTHER SERVICES, OR BE USED TO UNDERMINE 
EXISTING OR FUTURE EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC AND VOLUNTARY 
SECTORS.

ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES WOULD BE FULL WORKERS IN EVERY RESPECT: 
HOLIDAY PAY, DISABILITY BENEFIT, PROTECTIVE LABOUR LEGISLATION, PAY 
INCOME TAX AND PRSI CONTRIBUTIONS ETC.

-OPERATE AT A NET COST OF APPROXIMATELY £50 MILLION AFTER SOCIAL 
WELFARE SAVINGS, TAX REVENUES AND EC SUBSIDIES ARE TAKEN INTO 
ACCOUNT. THIS EXPENDITURE WOULD BE FINANCED BY THE RE-
INTRODUCTION OF A STRENGTHENED WEALTH TAX.

AER LINGUS: MANY OF THE LEADING FIGURES IN DEMOCRATIC LEFT ARE 
AMONG THOSE WHO IN THE 1970'S WERE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
DEVELOPING THE POLICY OF PROMOTING STATE ENTERPRISE AS THE ENGINE 
OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN IRELAND. 
DURING THE DECADE OF REAGAN/THATCHER, THAT VIEW BECAME RATHER 
UNFASHIONABLE, BUT AS THE CHICKENS COME HOME TO ROOST ON THE 
FAILED POLICIES OF THOSE YEARS IT IS TIME TO REVIEW THE ROLE OF THE 
STATE SECTOR. AER LINGUS, LONG REGARDED AS THE JEWEL IN THE PUBLIC 
SECTOR CROWN, IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND VALUABLE 
IRISH COMPANY, BAR NONE, WHEN ACCOUNT IS TAKEN OF ITS SOCIAL AS 
WELL AS ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE. NOWHERE IS THIS 
REMARKABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE IRISH ECONOMY BETTER CATALOGUED 
THAN IN "THE PLANE TRUTH", AN AER LINGUS STAFF PUBLICATION. 
NOW THAT THE VERY SURVIVAL OF AER LINGUS IS UNDER THREAT AS A 
RESULT OF THE PROLONGED RECESSION, WHICH HAS SEVERELY AFFECTED 
ALMOST ALL INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES, IT IS ENTITLED TO OUR FULL SUPPORT. 
DEMOCRATIC LEFT SUPPORTS THE DEMAND THAT THE STATE AS SOLE 
SHAREHOLDER SHOULD PROVIDE A CAPITAL INJECTION TO REDUCE THE 
COMPANY'S APPALLING DEBT/EQUITY RATIO AND ITS ANNUAL INTEREST BILL 
CURRENTLY RUNNING AT £58 MILLION. 
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IN THE NEW DEREGULATED STATE OF EUROPEAN 
AVIATION AER LINGUS NEEDS TO MAKE AN ALLIANCE WITH ONE OR MORE 
AIRLINES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY SQUEEZED OUT BY 
THE MEGA-CARRIERS. HOWEVER, REDUCING THEIR DEBT IS A PREREQUISITE 
TO ENTERING MEANINGFUL NEGOTIATIONS AND PROCURING THE SORT OF 
AGREEMENT THAT WOULD ENSURE ITS DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION. 
THE NATIONAL INTEREST DEMANDS THAT WE DO NO LESS. 

AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT: THE RECENT REFORM OF THE 
COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY HAS CREATED SOME PROBLEMS FOR 
IRISH AGRICULTURE BUT IT HAS ALSO CREATED NEW OPPORTUNITIES. WE 
BELIEVE THAT THE EMPHASIS MUST NOW BE PLACED ON DIVERSIFICATION 
IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WITH CROPS BEING DEVELOPED IN 
RESPONSE TO IDENTIFIED MARKET NEEDS, E.G. QUALITY VEGETABLES, 
ORGANIC FOOD PRODUCTION, INDUSTRIAL CROPS FOR THE FOOD 
PROCESSING INDUSTRY, INCREASED AFFORESTATION IN AREAS OF POOR 
AGRICULTURAL LAND AND AN INTENSIFICATION OF HORTICULTURAL 
PRODUCTION. 
FARM BASED PRODUCTION MUST ALSO BE SUPPORTED BY MORE RURAL 
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY TO INTEGRATE SOCIAL TOURISM, WILD LIFE 
MANAGEMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND RELATED ACTIVITIES 
WHICH HELP THE RURAL ECONOMY. DEMOCRATIC LEFT WANTS TO SEE A 
MAJOR EXPANSION OF THE EC LEADER PROGRAMME TO STIMULATE A 
WHOLE RANGE OF INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES. 

TAX AND SOCIAL WELFARE 

THE TAX AND SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEMS MUST BE RADICALLY REFORMED. 
THEY MUST BE HARMONISED WITH EACH OTHER. AT PRESENT THEY OFTEN 
OPERATE AT CROSS PURPOSES, CREATING POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT 
TRAPS. THEY MUST ALSO BE MADE TO SERVE OUR PRIORITY OBJECTIVES OF 
JOB CREATION AND INCOME EQUITY. AT PRESENT, THEY DON'T ALWAYS DO 
SO. 
THIS MEANS THREE THINGS: 
• EVERYONE SHOULD BE IN THE TAX SYSTEM AND SHOULD PAY TAX ON ALL 
INCOME, WHATEVER ITS SOURCE, ONCE IT EXCEEDS A     CERTAIN AMOUNT.

• THE SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM MUST ENSURE THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE 
AN ADEQUATE PERSONAL INCOME, WHATEVER THEIR SEX, MARITAL 
OCCUPATIONAL, FAMILY OR OTHER STATUS. 

• THE TAX THRESHOLDS MUST COINCIDE, BROADLY, WITH THE MINIMUM 
INCOME LEVELS AND PRSI MUST NOT UPSET THE BALANCE. 

AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM: INTEGRATING TAX AND SOCIAL WELFARE SO AS TO 
PROVIDE MINIMUM INCOMES AND REMOVE POVERTY TRAPS WOULD 
INDICATE A REAL SOCIAL COMMITMENT TO ENDING POVERTY, TO SHARING 
WEALTH AND TO REMOVING THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO WOMEN'S EQUALITY - 
THE ABSENCE OF FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE. IT COULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE, 
IN A SMALL WAY, TO JOB CREATION. 

A SYSTEM WHICH GUARANTEES MINIMUM INCOMES WOULD DO MORE 
THAN JUST LIBERATE UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE FROM THE PRESENT PERVERSE 
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MUST NOT WORK - AN IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE IN 
ITSELF. BY PROVIDING ALL CITIZENS WITH A BASIC LEVEL OF FINANCIAL 
SECURITY IT COULD ALSO ACT AS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR NEW ECONOMIC 
ACTIVITY AND NON-TRADITIONAL VENTURES, ENCOURAGING INDIVIDUAL 
CREATIVE ACTIVITY. 

RECENT SOCIAL WELFARE CHANGES HAVE MOVED THE SYSTEM IN 
COMPLETELY THE WRONG DIRECTION - AWAY FROM COMPREHENSIVE 
INCOME SUPPORT AT ADEQUATE LEVELS, TOWARDS MORE AND MORE 
MEANS-TESTING AND REDUCTIONS IN BENEFIT LEVELS. THIS YEAR ALONE, 
FIANNA FAIL MINISTER CHARLIE MCCREEVY HAS CUT MATERNITY BENEFITS 
FOR THE LOWEST PAID WOMEN WORKERS AND STOPPED IT FOR OTHERS; 
REDUCED INJURY BENEFIT FROM £65 TO £53 PER WEEK; STARTED MEANS-
TESTING DESERTED WIVES; SCRAPPED PAY-RELATED BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE 
WHO ARE SICK; ABOLISHED THE 'ALLEVIATION PAYMENTS' FOR MEN 
INSTEAD OF EXTENDING THEM TO WOMEN AS RECOMMENDED BY THE 
EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE, AND DISCOURAGED THE UNEMPLOYED 
FROM TAKING UP ANY CASUAL WORK THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE (BY 
REDUCING THEIR DOLE EVEN FOR DAYS NOT WORKED). 

WHAT IS THIS VICTIMISATION SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVE ? A GREATER 
INCENTIVE TO WORK - DESPITE THE LACK OF JOBS ? A GREATER INCENTIVE 
TO EMIGRATE ? OR DESCENT INTO EVER GREATER DESPAIR ? IT CERTAINLY 
WILL NOT SAVE MONEY. 

LONG RANGE ACCOUNTING: DEMOCRATIC LEFT HAS MAJOR CRITICISMS OF 
THE PRESENT NATIONAL ACCOUNTING METHODS. THEY SHOULD BE 
REVIEWED, RESTRUCTURED AND REQUIRED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FULL, 
TRUE COST OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY IN OUR SOCIETY. SOCIAL 
WELFARE EXPENDITURE, FOR EXAMPLE, MUST BE EXAMINED IN THE 
CONTEXT OF THE HEALTH, HOUSING, POLICING, EDUCATION AND OTHER 
COSTS WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND PROLONGED 
POVERTY. KEEPING PEOPLE IN POVERTY, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE SOCIAL 
WELFARE BUDGET DOWN, ISN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO KEEP BUDGETS 
DOWN IN OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, CERTAINLY NOT IN THE LONG 
RUN

ALL THE RECENT CUTS IN SOCIAL WELFARE SHOULD BE REVERSED AND OTHER 
PLANNED CHANGES (SUCH AS GIVING PART-TIME WORKERS LOWER 
BENEFITS THAN OTHER INSURED WORKERS, OR TAXING CERTAIN PAYMENTS) 
SHOULD BE REVIEWED CAREFULLY AND PERHAPS HALTED. 

FAIR TAR INCREASES: IF EVERY CITIZEN IS TO ENJOY AN ADEQUATE 
INCOME, MORE WEALTH MUST BE CREATED AND MORE TAXATION RAISED. 
IF ALL INCOMES, AND ALL FORMS OF INCOME, WERE BROUGHT INTO THE 
TAX NET, FAIRLY LARGE AMOUNTS COULD BE RAISED. CORPORATE BODIES 
SHOULD ALSO HAVE TO PAY MORE: WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE 
REQUIRED TAX AT A MINIMUM RATE OF 10% - MOST PAY FAR LESS. THERE 
SHOULD BE NO QUESTION OF REDUCING EMPLOYERS' PRSI, WHICH IS 
OFTEN THE ONLY CONTRIBUTION MADE BY CERTAIN COMPANIES TOWARDS 
THE IRISH EXCHEQUER AND THE SOCIAL PROTECTION OF WORKERS IN 
IRELAND, UNLESS AND UNTIL AN ADEQUATE CONTRIBUTION IS MADE 
THROUGH ANOTHER MECHANISM. AN ENERGY TAX, GEARED TO 
ENCOURAGING CONSERVATION AND CREATING EXTRA JOBS, COULD ALSO 
HELP RAISE ADDITIONAL MONIES WHILE ACHIEVING DESIRABLE SOCIAL AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES. 

FUTURE GOVERNMENTS FACE A CHALLENGE TO CHANGE POPULAR 
PERCEPTIONS OF BOTH THE TAX AND SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEMS AS SIMPLY 
PUNITIVE BURDENS, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE RICH AND ON THE POOR. THE 
ONLY WAY OF DOING THIS WILL BE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT TAXPAYERS' 
MONEY IS BEING USED EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY FOR A COMBINATION 
OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PURPOSES WITH WHICH THEY CAN POSITIVELY 
IDENTIFY.       

WOMEN

EQUALITY FOR WOMEN IS A PRIORITY FOR DEMOCRATIC LEFT. EQUALITY 
ISSUES ARE AT THE HEART OF HOW OUR SOCIETY IS STRUCTURED AND MUST 
BE A PRIME CONCERN OF ANY PARTY COMMITTED TO CHANGE AND 
PROGRESS. 

WE PROPOSE

DEPARTMENT FOR WOMEN: A PORTFOLIO WITH FULL CABINET STATUS AND 
A REALISTIC BUDGET SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO MONITOR AND ENCOURAGE 
PROGRESS TOWARDS EQUALITY. 
CHARTER OF EQUALITY RIGHTS: A CLEAR STATEMENT OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS 
SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE CONSTITUTION TO REDRESS THE 
PRESENT SITUATION IN WHICH WOMEN ARE NOT RECOGNISED AS EQUAL 
AND INDEPENDENT CITIZENS. ALL LEGISLATION WOULD THEN BE 
SUPPORTED CONSTITUTIONALLY. 
EMPLOYMENT STRATEGIES: AN ANALYSIS OF THE PHENOMENAL RISE IN 
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT OVER RECENT YEARS IS NEEDED TO UNDERPIN 
AN EMPLOYMENT ACTION PLAN WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE REMOVAL OF 
EXISTING DISCRIMINATIONS AGAINST WOMEN. ECONOMIC 
INDEPENDENCE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO EQUALITY AND CAN ONLY BE 
ACHIEVED WITH THE TAX AND WELFARE REFORMS WHICH WILL ENSURE A 
MINIMUM INCOME, AND GENUINELY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE 
WORKPLACE. 
LEGAL REFORMS: EXISTING EQUALITY LEGISLATION MUST BE 
STRENGTHENED AND EXTENDED TO AREAS SUCH AS ACCESS TO GOODS AND 
SERVICES, SPORTING AND OTHER FACILITIES AND TRAINING AND 
APPRENTICESHIPS. 
FAMILY LAW REFORM: WE SUPPORT THE RIGHT TO DIVORCE, PROTECTION 
AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FULL EQUALITY OF ACCESS TO THE LAW. 
EDUCATION: ADULT AND CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR WOMEN MUST HAVE 
THE FUNDING AND SUPPORT SERVICES TO ALLOW WOMEN TO AVAIL OF 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
HEALTH: COST CUTTING IN SERVICES VERY OFTEN HITS WOMEN FIRST. WE 
NEED TO PUT SPECIAL MEASURES IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN 
RECEIVE THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED, INCLUDING THE RESTORATION OF FULL 
MATERNITY BENEFITS.

ENVIRONMENT

THE WORLD IS FACING AN ECOLOGICAL CRISIS. THE DEVELOPED WORLD 
HAS ABUSED THE EARTH'S RESOURCES; POVERTY AND DEBT IS FORCING THE 
UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO DESTROY RESOURCES WHICH ARE 
ESSENTIAL TO THE PLANET'S SURVIVAL AND TO ITS ECOLOGICAL BALANCE. 
THE DESTRUCTION OF RAIN FORESTS, GLOBAL WARMING, OZONE DEPLETION 
AND DESERTIFICATION ARE ALL MANIFESTATIONS OF A CRISIS WHICH 
THREATENS THE FUTURE OF THE GLOBE. WE ALL HAVE A PART TO PLAY IN 
AVERTING IT. 
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND REPAIRING THE DAMAGE ALREADY 
DONE REQUIRES BALANCING THE NEED TO USE THE EARTH'S RESOURCES FOR 
SURVIVAL AND OUR OBLIGATION TO CONSERVE AND RENEW THOSE 
RESOURCES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS; BALANCING THE DISTRIBUTION OF 
WEALTH BETWEEN RICH AND POOR, BETWEEN THE DEVELOPED WORLD AND 
THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; BALANCING THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT AND 
THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. 
PEOPLE ARE PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR NEEDS TO SURVIVE, TO 
HAVE WORK, TO HAVE DIGNITY, TO HAVE A HOME CANNOT BE SEPARATED 
FROM THE NEED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. 
NATIONAL POLICY: WE INSIST THAT THIS COUNTRY ADOPTS A RESPONSIBLE 
INTERNATIONAL POSITION ON THE ENVIRONMENT. WE SHOULD BE LEADING 
THE DRIVE TO SAVE THE WORLD, NOT TRAILING BEHIND. WE MUST ADDRESS 
OUR OWN ENVIRONMENT, PUTTING EMPHASIS ON PREVENTING POLLUTION 
RATHER THAN JUST CONTROLLING IT; ADOPTING A NATIONAL WASTE 
MANAGEMENT PLAN INSTEAD OF AD HOC MEASURES, AND DEVELOPING 
OUR ECONOMY ON THE BASIS OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. 
DEVOLUTION OF POWER: WE WANT TO RESTORE PEOPLE'S POWER OVER 
THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY. LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND REFORMED SO THAT LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES CAN EXERT REAL CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN AREAS. 
NUCLEAR WASTE: SELLAFIELD MUST BE PHASED OUT. NO FURTHER 
EXPANSION, ESPECIALLY FOR NUCLEAR FUEL REPROCESSING OF 
INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR WASTE, MUST BE ALLOWED. AN ALL PARTY 
AGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS OBJECTIVE WILL BE A PRIORITY 
FOR DEMOCRATIC LEFT. 
WASTE AND RECYCLING: AN OBJECTIVE FOR THE 90S MUST BE AN END TO 
ALL WASTE AND SEWAGE DUMPING IN OUR WATERCOURSES AND SEAS. ALL 
WASTE MUST BE RECYCLED AND PUT TO GOOD USE. OUR WATERS - A 
VITALLY PRECIOUS ASSET - MUST BE PROTECTED.

HOUSING

EVERY PERSON IS ENTITLED TO A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. GOOD QUALITY, 
SUITABLE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR ITS CITIZENS MUST BE A PRIMARY 
SOCIAL OBJECTIVE OF MODERN GOVERNMENT. 
PUBLIC HOUSING: AN EXPANDED LOCAL AUTHORITY COMMUNITY 
HOUSING INITIATIVE MUST AIM TO REDUCE THE HOUSING LIST 
SIGNIFICANTLY EACH YEAR AND ELIMINATE IT COMPLETELY BY 1997. THE 
TARGET MUST BE AT LEAST 35,000 DWELLINGS PER YEAR WITH A WIDE 
RANGE OF CONSTRUCTION FORMS AND TENURE OPTIONS. 
HOUSING MAINTENANCE POLICY:  A PROGRAMME MUST BE SET UP TO 
PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE REPAIR AND 
MAINTENANCE OF ALL HOUSING SECTORS. AN EMERGENCY PROGRAMME IS 
NEEDED TO MEET THE ACCOMMODATION NEEDS OF ELDERLY PEOPLE AND 
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THIS MUST PROVIDE A BROAD RANGE OF 
COMMUNITY, SHELTERED AND FULL CARE FACILITIES, WARDEN-MANAGED 
AND CONNECTED BY AUDIOLINK TO THE HOUSING MANAGEMENT SECTION 
OF EACH LOCAL AUTHORITY. 
MOBILITY IN PUBLIC SECTOR HOUSING IS FAR TOO RESTRICTIVE. NATIONAL, 
REGIONAL AND EC-WIDE MOBILITY AND EXCHANGE SCHEMES SHOULD BE 
DEVELOPED. 
 PRIVATE HOUSING:  FULL DEFECTS PROTECTION LEGISLATION IS NEEDED 
FOR BOTH OWNER-OCCUPIERS AND TENANT PURCHASERS AGAINST LONGER-
TERM DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS ON BEHALF OF THE DEVELOPER 
AND LOCAL AUTHORITY. THERE MUST BE LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT 
HOUSE AND FLAT CONSTRUCTION IS OF THE HIGHEST STANDARD AND THAT IT 
COMPLIES WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WITH REGARD TO MATERIALS 
AND SAFETY. 
MORTGAGES: THE CURRENCY SITUATION AND ASSOCIATED SHARP RISE IN 
INTEREST RATES HAS CREATED A CRISIS FOR MANY HOMEOWNERS WHOSE 
MONTHLY MORTGAGE REPAYMENTS HAVE ROCKETED, CREATING A FEAR OF 
LOSING THEIR HOMES. 
AS AN EMERGENCY MEASURE, THERE SHOULD BE A RESTORATION OF FULL 
TAX RELIEF FOR MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS. FOR THOSE WHO LOSE 
THEIR JOBS, THESE RELIEFS SHOULD BE CONVERTED TO A HOUSING 
SUBSIDY. GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT NO 
HOMES ARE LOST THROUGH REPOSSESSION DURING THE CURRENT CRISIS. 
THESE EXORBITANT INTEREST RATES MUST BE REDUCED ANYWAY BECAUSE 
OTHERWISE THEY WILL CRIPPLE THE ENTIRE ECONOMY. THIS CAN ONLY BE 
DONE THROUGH A CONCERTED EUROPEAN STRATEGY WHICH BRINGS DOWN 
GERMAN INTEREST RATES AND CONCENTRATES ON PROMOTING GROWTH AND 
EMPLOYMENT. 
TENANT RIGHTS:  A CHARTER OF TENANTS' RIGHTS COVERING TENURE, 
REPAIR, SPACE PROVISION, SANITARY SERVICES AND FIRE SAFETY IN BOTH 
THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RENTED SECTORS IS A MATTER OF URGENCY. 
 REFURBISHMENT: A REFURBISHMENT PROGRAMME FOR OLDER HOUSING 
STOCK, TOGETHER WITH SUITABLE IN-FILL SCHEMES, SHOULD BE SET IN 
MOTION AND AIDED BY APPROPRIATE FISCAL POLICY TO ENABLE AND 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LIVE IN INNER-CITY AREAS. 

EDUCATION 

EDUCATION IS CENTRAL TO THE DEMOCRATISATION OF SOCIETY. AS THE FIRST 
POLITICAL PARTY TO RESPOND TO THE RECENT GREEN PAPER, DEMOCRATIC 
LEFT CALLS FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE PROCESS TOWARDS A LEGISLATIVE 
FRAMEWORK FOR EDUCATION IN IRELAND BY THE NEXT GOVERNMENT AND 
DAIL. 
WHILE THE GREEN PAPER WAS WELCOME IN SOME OF ITS TARGETS AND 
EDUCATIONAL AIMS, THE LACK OF A RESOURCE COMMITMENT AND THE 
FF/PD GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO MEET EDUCATION COMMITMENTS IN 
THE PESP INDICATES THAT A STRONG CAMPAIGN FOR FREE, DEMOCRATIC 
AND HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION MUST BE MAINTAINED. 

RESOURCING: DEMOCRATIC LEFT SUPPORTS: 
• A PLAN TO BRING PER-CAPITA SPENDING ON EDUCATION UP TO OECD 
AVERAGE LEVELS; 
• THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FREE EDUCATION UP TO AND INCLUDING THIRD 
LEVEL WHICH REQUIRES PLANNING NOW; 
• AN INCREASE IN CAPITATION GRANTS TO PRIMARY AND POST-PRIMARY 
SCHOOLS AND THE CLOSING OF DISPARITIES BETWEEN FUNDING AT 
PRIMARY AND OTHER LEVELS; 

FAILURE TO FUND SCHOOLS RESULTS IN HUGE PRESSURE BOTH ON PARENTS 
AND IN AREAS TO FUNDRAISE, THUS REINFORCING INEQUALITY. MORE THAN 
25 MILLION IS NOW BEING SPENT BY THE STATE ON ELITE FEE-CHARGING 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS WHICH MUST BE RE-DIRECTED INTO PUBLIC 
EDUCATION. 

PARTICIPATION:   INEQUALITIES IN PARTICIPATION, MOST MARKED IN 
SOCIAL CLASS DISPARITIES IN THIRD LEVEL COLLEGES MUST BE TACKLED IN 
IRISH EDUCATION. 
WE PROPOSE: 
• A GRADUAL EXPANSION OF PRE-SCHOOLING, INTEGRATED WITH THE 
PRIMARY SCHOOLS ( AFTER SOME 20 YEARS THERE IS STILL ONLY ONE STATE 
PRE-SCHOOL - RUTLAND ST. DUBLIN.) 
• REDUCTION OF THE COMPULSORY SCHOOLGOING AGE TO 5 YEARS, THUS 
REFLECTING CURRENT PRACTICE AND ENSURING GREATER RESOURCING TO THE 
VITAL AREA OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION; 
• REDUCTION IN CLASS SIZE TO EC AVERAGE LEVELS WITHIN FIVE YEARS, 
STARTING WITH A MAXIMUM CLASS SIZE OF 25 IN INFANT CLASSES. 
• AN INTER-DEPARTMENTAL TASKFORCE TO TACKLE ALL ASPECTS OF 
'DISADVANTAGE'; 
• A GUARANTEE OF QUALITY FOR PARENTS/PUPILS - EFFECTIVE SCHOOLS 
MUST CATER AT A MINIMUM FOR LITERACY/NUMERACY NEEDS AND 
REMEDIAL TEACHING SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN ALL SCHOOLS. 
• FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES WITH STUDENTS AT POST-COMPULSORY 
SCHOOLING AND SPECIAL PROGRAMMES FOR EARLY LEAVERS. AT PRESENT, 
A YOUTHREACH GROUP OF 25 ATTRACTS £35,000 IN PUBLIC FUNDING 
MONEY WHICH MIGHT BE BETTER SPENT EARLIER AS AN INVESTMENT 
AGAINST EARLY LEAVING DUE TO FAILURE. 
• EXPANSION OF THE GRANTS SYSTEM AT 3RD LEVEL AND COSTING OF A 
'STUDENT WAGE' CONCEPT; 
• A STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR ADULT EDUCATION AND EDUCATION ACCESS 
SCHEMES FOR ADULTS WITHOUT FORMAL SCHOOL QUALIFICATIONS; 
• AN END TO THE SCANDAL OF WAITING LISTS FOR PLACES IN SPECIAL 
EDUCATION. 

DEMOCRACY:   THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE PROPERLY 
ACCOUNTABLE AND DEMOCRATIC. WE PROPOSE 

• STATE GRANTS TO SCHOOLS TO BE LINKED TO REGULATIONS ON ACCESS AND 
MANAGEMENT. 
• DEMOCRATIC SCHOOL BOARDS WITH EQUAL REPRESENTATION OF INTERESTS 
• SCHOOL OWNERSHIP BE VESTED IN THE FUNDING INTERESTS, IN 
PROPORTION TO THEIR INVESTMENT; 
• A STRONGER SCHOOLS INSPECTORATE; 
• AN INTERMEDIATE STRUCTURE, SIMILAR TO THE VECS TO OVERSEE 
EDUCATION ON A REGIONAL BASIS; 

GENERAL 
• BROADENING OF THE RANGE OF COMPETENCES WHICH ARE ASSESSED 
SINCE SCHOOLS TEND TO BE GUIDED BY TERMINAL ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS; 
• A BROAD CURRICULUM FOR THE COMPULSORY PERIOD NOT OMITTING THE 
ARTS/HUMANITIES AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC/TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION;
• AN APPRENTICESHIP SYSTEM WHICH HAS SUFFICIENT EDUCATIONAL 
CONTENT TO ENSURE VERSATILE, MULTISKILLED WORKERS;
• ENTITLEMENT TO REGULAR (OBLIGATORY) TEACHER IN-SERVICE TRAINING.

 HEALTH

HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL AND ACCESS TO CARE SHOULD 
BE BASED ON NEED RATHER THAN ABILITY TO PAY. DEMOCRATIC LEFT 
RECOGNISES THAT SOCIAL FACTORS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN DETERMINING THE 
HEALTH OF BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE. HEALTH 
POLICY MUST, THEREFORE, ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AS WELL AS PURELY 
MEDICAL ISSUES. 
• WE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITIVE PROMOTION OF HEALTH IS AS IMPORTANT 
AS CARING FOR THOSE WHO ARE ILL. DEMOCRATIC LEFT BELIEVES THAT 
HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE BASED IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT GENERAL 
PRACTICE AND OTHER PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES SHOULD PLAY A 
PIVOTAL ROLE IN THE PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE. 
ACCESS FOR ALL: THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT POVERTY, 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND POOR HOUSING HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON 
HEALTH AND VIRTUALLY ALL FORMS OF ILL-HEALTH ARE COMMONER IN THE 
UNEMPLOYED AND THE POOR. THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT HAS 
ENCOURAGED THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIVATE HEALTH CARE BY 
SUBSIDISING THE VHI THROUGH TAX RELIEF WHILE MAKING DRASTIC 
CUTBACKS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THE GMS SCHEME MUST 
BE PROPERLY FUNDED WHICH, AS THE CURRENT DISPUTE CLEARLY 
INDICATES, IT IS NOT AT PRESENT, AND IT SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO THE 
WHOLE POPULATION. 
THE CURRENT RATIO OF HOSPITAL CONSULTANTS TO JUNIOR DOCTORS IS TOO 
LOW AND MANY PUBLIC PATIENTS ARE BEING DEALT WITH BY 
INADEQUATELY SUPERVISED JUNIOR DOCTORS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE 
NUMBER OF CONSULTANTS SHOULD BE INCREASED SO THAT THE SYSTEM 
BECOMES A CONSULTANT-BASED SERVICE. WHERE WAITING LISTS EXIST 
THERE SHOULD BE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
PATIENTS AND ALL SHOULD BE ON THE SAME WAITING LIST. 
COMMUNITY BASE : THE HEALTH SERVICES IN IRELAND ARE DOMINATED 
BY THE HOSPITAL SECTOR AND THERE HAS BEEN CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING 
OF GENERAL PRACTICE AND OTHER PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. DEMOCRATIC 
LEFT BELIEVES THAT RESOURCES SHOULD BE REDIRECTED INTO GENERAL 
PRACTICE AND OTHER COMMUNITY SERVICES. GENERAL PRACTICE PLAYS A 
PIVOTAL "GATE KEEPER" ROLE IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO HOSPITAL SERVICES 
AND, AS WELL AS IMPROVING QUALITY OF CARE, INVESTMENT WILL BE 
COST EFFECTIVE. 
INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION. DEMOCRATIC LEFT RECOGNISES THAT THE 
PROMOTION OF HEALTH IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE TREATMENT OF ILLNESS. 
WE SUPPORT THE PROVISION OF COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH EDUCATION AND 
APPROPRIATE SCREENING AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE 
MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE POVERTY AND 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND DETERMINATION TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES IS VITALLY 
IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY. 

PERSONAL SECURITY, JUSTICE AND CIVIL LIBERTIES

POLICING: TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FROM CRIME IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE 
A POLICE SERVICE WHICH COMMANDS WIDE COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND 
RESPECT, AND WHICH HAS THE RESOURCES TO CARRY OUT ITS DUTIES 
EFFECTIVELY. 
ACCOUNTABILITY AT LOCAL LEVEL IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT WHICH CAN BE 
DEVELOPED EFFECTIVELY, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF EXISTING GARDA 
ORGANISATION, THROUGH LOCAL GARDA LIAISON COMMITTEES, 
DEMOCRATICALLY APPOINTED AND WITH A CONSULTATIVE ROLE. THERE IS A 
NEED ALSO FOR A GARDA AUTHORITY WHICH WOULD REMOVE THE GARDA 
SIOCHANA FROM IMMEDIATE POLITICAL INFLUENCE. 
VICTIM SUPPORT: ONE OF THE MOST NEGLECTED AREAS WITHIN THE LEGAL 
SYSTEM AS IT CURRENTLY OPERATES IS THAT OF HELP AND SUPPORT FOR 
VICTIMS OF CRIME. THE ASSOCIATION FOR VICTIM SUPPORT SHOULD BE 
SUPPORTED FINANCIALLY TO CARRY OUT ITS VALUABLE WORK. THE POWERS 
OF THE CRIMINAL INJURIES COMPENSATION TRIBUNAL SHOULD BE FULLY 
RESTORED TO ALLOW IT TO MEET MORE ADEQUATELY THE NEEDS OF CRIME 
VICTIMS. 
CIVIL LIBERTIES : IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR VIEW OF CIVIL LIBERTIES 
THAT FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL SHALL BE RESPECTED AND SUPPORTED. 
THOSE FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS SHOULD BE BASED ON A SECULAR 
FOUNDATION, RESPECTING PRIVATE VIEWS OF MORALITY AND ENSURING A 
DISTINCT SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE IN ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS. 
ACCESS TO THE LAW: ALL CITIZENS MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THE LAW, 
REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME. THE SCANDALOUS FINANCIAL NEGLECT OF 
THE CIVIL LEGAL AID SCHEME MUST BE ENDED AND GUARANTEED 
FUNDING PUT IN PLACE FOR THIS FUNDAMENTAL OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. 
THE PROCESS OF LITIGATION MUST BE SIMPLIFIED AND RENDERED LESS 
COSTLY. WE WELCOME THE INTRODUCTION OF A SMALL CLAIMS COURT 
AND URGE THAT IT BE EXTENDED AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY. 
LAW REFORM: A CRIMINAL LAW REFORM DIVISION OF THE LAW REFORM 
COMMISSION SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. THE OIREACHTAS SHOULD BE 
REQUIRED TO ADDRESS EACH REPORT AND SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM 
THE COMMISSION WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF PUBLICATION. 

REFORM OF THE LAW ON HOMOSEXUALITY: IRELAND IS IN BREACH OF 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS THROUGH ITS FAILURE TO 
DECRIMINALISE HOMOSEXUAL ACTS BETWEEN CONSENTING ADULTS. THE 
LAW IN THIS REGARD MUST BE AMENDED WITHOUT DELAY IN ORDER TO END 
LEGAL DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAYS. THE GOVERNMENT'S 
PREVARICATION ON THIS ISSUE, INCLUDING THEIR RECENT APPLICATION FOR 
A FURTHER EXTENSION IS SHAMEFUL AND DAMAGING TO IRELAND'S 
REPUTATION ABROAD. DEMOCRATIC LEFT WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE 
GOVERNMENT ON THIS ISSUE IN THE NEW DAIL AND ALSO IN THE 
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WHERE IT HAS ALREADY RAISED THE ISSUE ON 
SEVERAL OCCASIONS. 
PRISON REFORM: THE WHITAKER REPORT ON PRISON REFORM IS A 
HUMANE AND RESPECTED DOCUMENT, THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF 
WHICH WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL TO SOLVE THE DEPLORABLE SITUATION IN 
MANY PRISONS. A TIMETABLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS 
RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE AGREED AS A MATTER OF URGENCY BY THE 
INCOMING MINISTER RESPONSIBLE. 
PENAL POLICY: THE USE OF NON CUSTODIAL PENALTIES FOR NON VIOLENT 
CRIME SHOULD BE THE FIRST RESORT. IMPRISONMENT FOR CIVIL DEBT AND 
INABILITY TO PAY MONETARY FINES SHOULD END. 

THE ELDERLY

THE ELDERLY SHARE MANY NEEDS IN COMMON BUT THEY ARE NOT A ONE-
DIMENSIONAL MASS OF PEOPLE. DEMOCRATIC LEFT COMMITS ITSELF TO 
AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE ORGANISATIONS 
ESTABLISHED BY THE ELDERLY THEMSELVES, E.G. THE IRISH ASSOCIATION 
OF OLDER PEOPLE, ACTIVE AGE GROUPS, FEDERATION OF RETIRED 
PEOPLE. WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR OLDER PEOPLE DO NOT BECOME 
MERE CLIENTS OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS BUT SHAPERS OF THAT PROCESS. 
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS CERTAIN POLICIES MUST BE PUT INTO ACTION. 
HOMES AND HOUSING: TO ENSURE THAT, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT 
POSSIBLE AND FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, OLDER PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO LIVE IN THEIR OWN HOMES IN COMFORT, DIGNITY AND SAFETY. THIS 
WILL REQUIRE RESOURCES FOR RENOVATIONS AND ADAPTATIONS, A BETTER 
HOME HELP SERVICE AND AID TO COMMUNITY ACTIVITY. THE STANDARDS 
AND COSTS OF NURSING HOMES MUST BE RIGOROUSLY MAINTAINED AT THE 
BEST ACHIEVABLE TARGET, BY THE STATE, FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT REMAIN 
AT HOME. 
HEALTH CARE: CHIROPODY SERVICES, DENTAL SERVICES, OPTICAL AND 
OPHTHALMIC SERVICES MUST BE GEARED TO THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE 
ELDERLY AND FUNDED AND MADE ACCESSIBLE ACCORDINGLY. 
TRANSPORT: ALL PUBLIC TRANSPORT MUST BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE ELDERLY 
AND DISCRIMINATORY EXCLUSIONS MUST BE ABOLISHED . 
INCOME: PENSIONS FOR ELDERLY MUST BE INCREASED TO REALISTIC 
VALUES AND MAINTAINED IN PURCHASING POWER. 
VOLUNTARY AND COMMUNITY GROUPS: THERE MUST BE GREATER STATE 
SUPPORT FOR BEFRIENDING AND COMPANION SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY, 
PARTICULARLY IN ISOLATED SITUATIONS IN BOTH RURAL AND CITY AREAS. 
DEMOCRATIC LEFT IS PLEDGED TO SEEK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED IN THE DEFINITIVE DOCUMENT 'THE 
YEARS AHEAD'- THE REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON SERVICES FOR THE 
ELDERLY. 

CULTURE AND THE ARTS

THE PURPOSE OF A CULTURAL POLICY IS TO PRODUCE CONDITIONS WHICH 
ENCOURAGE GENUINE SELF EXPRESSION BY THE PEOPLE OF A SOCIETY AND 
OFFER DEMOCRATIC ACCESS TO A SHARED CULTURE TO ALL. IT IS NOT TO 
DICTATE THE CONTENT OF CULTURAL LIFE OR THE GUIDELINES FOR CREATIVE 
AND ARTISTIC WORK. THE ARTS HAVE A CRUCIAL AND CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY 
IN GIVING SOCIETY A SENSE OF ITSELF, BUT THAT SENSE MUST BE 
INFORMED BY VISIONS OF REALITY, FREELY EXPRESSED. THUS, THOUGH 
THE FUNDING OF THE ARTS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE, THERE IS 
NO PLACE IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY FOR "STATE ART". 
BROADCASTING   OF ALL THE CULTURAL OUTLETS, BROADCASTING HAS 
PERHAPS MOST IMPACT ON OUR LIVES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ADVENT OF 
COMMERCIAL RADIO STATIONS, RTE CONTINUES TO PLAY A UNIQUE ROLE 
PROVIDING NECESSARY BUT UNPROFITABLE SERVICES OF QUALITY, CATERING 
FOR MINORITIES WHILE SERVING THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. RTE HAS 
THE RIGHT TO ATTRACT ADVERTISING WITHOUT CURBS, TO KEEP LICENCE FEES 
LOW, AND TO PLAN APPROPRIATELY. 
FILM DESPITE SOME SPECTACULAR INTERNATIONAL SUCCESSES, THE IRISH 
FILM INDUSTRY HAS BEEN BADLY NEGLECTED. IT IS CLEARLY TIME TO RE 
ESTABLISH THE FILM BOARD, CREATE A TAX-BASED INCENTIVE SCHEME 
WITH MONITORING CONTROLS, AND INVEST IN THE SUPPORTIVE 
INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING TRAINING, AND THE OTHER NECESSARY 
FACILITIES. THE OBJECT IS NOT TO CREATE AN 'IRISH HOLLYWOOD' BUT TO 
FACILITATE THE CINEMATIC EXPRESSION OF THE IRISH EXPERIENCE IN AWAY 
WHICH INFORMS AND ENTERTAINS. 
LITERATURE OUR LITERARY HERITAGE HAS BEEN UNDERMINED BY 
MULTINATIONAL PUBLISHING CONTROL, INADEQUATE LIBRARY FUNDING AND 
A GROWING PROBLEM OF ILLITERACY DUE TO EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT. 
POLICY SHOULD TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE CLASS CHARACTER OF 
CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY, AND BE ENCOURAGED BY DEMOCRATICALLY 
CONTROLLED STATE BODIES. 
PERFORMING ARTS A NATIONAL PERFORMING ARTS AUTHORITY SHOULD 
BE SET UP TO DEVELOP THEATRE POLICY GENERALLY, TO SUPERVISE 
FUNDING AND ENCOURAGE ACCESS TO THE PERFORMING ARTS WITH A 
STRONG EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT. THIS AUTHORITY SHOULD WORK WITH 
A BODY COMPRISED OF PROFESSIONALS ON THE MODEL OF AOSDANA, BUT 
EXPANDED AND DEMOCRATICALLY BASED. 
VISUAL ARTS: STATE SUPPORT FOR THE VISUAL ARTS MUST LINK EDUCATION, 
THE ARTS COUNCIL LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AND ARTISTS' REPRESENTATIVE 
BODIES. THE INTEGRATION OF ARTISTS' STUDIOS/SMALL FACTORIES WITH 
HOUSING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MOST EUROPEAN CITIES AND MORE 
REGIONAL ARTS CENTRES ARE REQUIRED IN AN OVERALL PLAN OF COHERENT 
DEVELOPMENT 
MUSIC: AN INDEPENDENT COUNCIL SHOULD BE SET UP WITH STATE FUNDS 
TO ADVISE, ASSIST AND ENCOURAGE MUSICIANS IN ALL GENRES. THE 
COUNCIL SHOULD RUN PERFORMANCE CENTRES TO PROVIDE EXPOSURE FOR 
HIGH QUALITY BANDS. 
HERITAGE: OUR HERITAGE, BOTH NATURAL AND BUILT, HAS BEEN SAVAGED 
FOR FAR TOO LONG BY COMMERCIAL INTERESTS. THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF 
LAND, WATERWAYS AND BUILDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE OF INDUSTRIAL AND 
LOCAL AS WELL AS ARCHITECTURAL OR HISTORIC INTEREST, MUST BE 
PROTECTED BY ADEQUATE LEGISLATION. 

NORTHERN IRELAND

THIS ELECTION TAKES PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE INTER- PARTY TALKS ON 
THE FUTURE OF NORTHERN IRELAND HAVE COME TO A TEMPORARY HALT. 
TWENTY-THREE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE BRITISH TROOPS ARRIVED ON 
THE STREETS OF BELFAST AND DERRY AND MORE THAN 3,000 PEOPLE HAVE 
LOST THEIR LIVES WHILE TENS OF THOUSANDS HAVE SUFFERED SEVERE 
PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE. AT THE SAME TIME THE SOCIETY 
IN THE NORTH FACES SEVERE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE 
HIGHEST RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT OF ANY REGION IN THE UK AND THE 
WORST RATES OF LONG-TERM AND YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT. 
REALISTIC AND MAGNANIMOUS POLICY: THE NEGOTIATORS FROM THE 
OFFICIAL UNIONIST PARTY HAD GONE A CONSIDERABLE WAY TO ACCEPTING 
THE NEED FOR NEW STRUCTURES OF PARTNERSHIP GOVERNMENT IN 
NORTHERN IRELAND PLUS THE NEED FOR REAL INSTITUTIONS OF NORTH-
SOUTH CO-OPERATION. PARTIES IN THIS STATE SHOULD HAVE RESPONDED 
WITH MORE MAGNANIMITY THAN OUR NEGOTIATORS DISPLAYED. ARTICLES 
2 AND 3 ARE PERCEIVED BY NORTHERN UNIONISTS AS AN OFFENSIVE AND 
UNDEMOCRATIC REFUSAL OF THEIR NATIONAL IDENTITY. DE VALERA'S 
NATIONALISM HAS NOTHING TO OFFER THE CATHOLIC POPULATION OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND. 
THEIR IDENTITY AND RIGHTS CAN BEST BE EFFECTIVELY ENSURED THROUGH 
STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT IN WHICH THEIR POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES 
PARTICIPATE. IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO BUILD THESE STRUCTURES IF 
PARTIES LIKE FIANNA FAIL AND THE SDLP DROPPED THEIR CONTINUING 
EMPHASIS ON THE NEED FOR SOME GRANDER 32-COUNTY 'SOLUTION'. 
ANY SETTLEMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND WILL ENTAIL THE AGREEMENT OF 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS STATE AND NEW AND IMAGINATIVE FORMS OF 
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO STATES ARE MORE NECESSARY THAN 
EVER IN A COMMON EUROPEAN CONTEXT. 
NON-SECTARIAN COMMITMENT: WE SHOULD STOP PARTICIPATING IN THE 
STRUCTURES OF THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT AS DEFENDERS SOLELY OF 
THE INTERESTS OF NORTHERN CATHOLICS. THIS IS A SECTARIAN APPROACH 
AND ONLY CONFIRMS UNIONIST SUSPICIONS OF NORTH-SOUTH LINKS. OUR 
COMMITMENT SHOULD BE TO NEITHER CATHOLIC OR PROTESTANT BUT TO 
DOING ALL THAT WE CAN TO FOSTER PEACE AND A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL 
CULTURE. THE PEOPLE OF NORTHERN IRELAND MUST DECIDE THEIR OWN 
FUTURE DEMOCRATICALLY, FREE FROM COERCION. 

ARTICLES 2 AND 3: AN ASPIRATION TO UNITY BY CONSENT SHOULD 
REPLACE ARTICLES 2 AND 3 IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
NEW CHANNELS: NEW FORUMS OF CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO 
STATES ON THIS ISLAND SHOULD BE DEVELOPED IN A EUROPEAN CONTEXT. 
DEVOLUTION: SUBSTANTIAL POWERS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO DEMOCRATIC 
INSTITUTIONS WITHIN NORTHERN IRELAND 
A BILL OF RIGHTS: FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES GUARANTEED 
THEM WITHIN THE LAW SHOULD BE CODIFIED IN A SINGLE DOCUMENT. 
JOB CREATION:: A PLAN MUST BE DEVISED TO DEAL WITH THE TASK OF 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION THROUGHOUT NORTHERN IRELAND. 
THE 'SOCIAL EUROPE' DIMENSION OF THE EC PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT 
CONTEXT FOR SUCH RECONSTRUCTION. 
INTEGRATED EDUCATION:: A UNIFIED AND INTEGRATED EDUCATION SYSTEM 
MUST BE DEVELOPED AND SUPPORTED. 

EUROPE 

AS A EUROPEAN PARTY AND PART OF THE UNITED LEFT GROUP IN THE 
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, DEMOCRATIC LEFT IS WORKING WITH OTHER 
EUROPEAN SOCIALISTS TO BUILD A BETTER EUROPE FOR ALL EC CITIZENS 
AND TO CLOSE THE HUGE GAP IN LIVING STANDARDS BETWEEN IRISH 
CITIZENS AND MOST OF OUR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS. 
INCOMES IN IRELAND, PER PERSON, ARE ONLY 63% OF THE EC AVERAGE. 
THE GAP HAS NARROWED BY ONLY 2% SINCE WE JOINED IN 1973. 
WHY? PARTLY BECAUSE OF INTERNAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS BUT ALSO 
BECAUSE OF THE SHEER STRENGTH OF MARKET FORCES WHICH PULL JOBS 
AND PROFITS TO THE CENTRE OF WHAT IS NOW A EUROPEAN ECONOMY. 
• LEFT TO THEMSELVES THESE MARKET FORCES CAN ONLY ACCENTUATE THE 
MAIN ECONOMIC DIVISIONS AND CONFLICTS OF OUR TIME: 
• DIVISION WITHIN OUR COUNTRY OF CLASS, GENDER AND UNEQUAL 
ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES: 
• THE GLOBAL NORTH-SOUTH DIVIDE WHICH CAN ONLY BE OVERCOME BY 
RESPONSIBLE, CONCERTED ACTION AT EUROPEAN LEVEL TO STOP THE 
ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF POORER COUNTRIES: 
• THE WORLD-WIDE CONFLICT BETWEEN UNFETTERED PRODUCTION AND 
ECOLOGICAL PRESERVATION WHICH CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED BY 
INTERNATIONALLY CO-ORDINATED ACTION. 
• THE CYCLICAL CRISES GENERATED BY INTERNATIONAL MARKET FORCES 
WHICH RESULT IN PERIODIC RECESSIONS AND LARGE-SCALE 
UNEMPLOYMENT AND FOR WHICH NO EFFECTIVE CONTROLLING OR EVEN 
MODERATING MECHANISMS HAVE YET BEEN DEVISED. 
TO ADDRESS THESE INEQUALITIES WE WANT: 
STRONG EC INDUSTRIAL POLICY. WE MUST REDUCE SUBSIDIES AND 
INCENTIVES TO INDUSTRY AT THE CENTRE OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET AND 
INCREASE THEM TO INDUSTRY AT THE EDGES. OUR AIM IS TO BRING JOBS 
TO PEOPLE IN IRELAND RATHER THAN KEEP BRINGING PEOPLE FROM 
IRELAND TO JOBS AT THE CENTRE. 
AT 1.15% OF EUROPE'S GNP, THE EC'S 1992 BUDGET IS 
APATHETICALLY INADEQUATE BASIS FOR A REAL 'PEOPLE'S EUROPE'. BUT 
SIMPLY INCREASING STRUCTURAL FUNDING IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER. A 
RANGE OF FAR-REACHING SOCIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES ARE 
NEEDED IF THE POORER REGIONS, SUCH AS IRELAND, ARE TO BECOME FULL 
AND EQUAL PARTNERS AT EVERY LEVEL. 

SOCIAL CHARTER: THIS MUST BECOME A REALITY RATHER THAN A MERE 
PIOUS ASPIRATION. IN PARTICULAR, IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A 
STRENGTHENING AND BROADENING OF EC EQUALITY LAW, WHICH HAS 
BEEN A VALUABLE WEAPON IN THE STRUGGLE OF IRISH WOMEN FOR EQUAL 
TREATMENT IN ALL SPHERES OF LIVE. 
CO-OPERATION: IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WE ARE WELL PLACED TO 
LEARN FROM AND WORK WITH THE MANY EUROPEAN SOCIALISTS, 
GREENS, AND OTHER PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING TO END 
GLOBAL NORTH-SOUTH DIVISIONS AND THE WORLD-WIDE DESTRUCTION OF 
THE ENVIRONMENT BY UNCONTROLLED MARKET FORCES. WE ARE 
COMMITTED TO JOINING WITH OTHERS OF LIKE MIND TO HARNESS 
ECONOMIC CAPACITY, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL, IN THE INTERESTS OF THOSE 
WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN WEAKEST AND HAVE BENEFITED LEAST. 
THIS MEANS ACTION TOGETHER WITH, AND ON BEHALF OF, THE 
UNEMPLOYED AND UNDERPRIVILEGED, ESPECIALLY AT THE MARGINS OF 
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY; THE WOMEN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHO TEND 
TO BE AT THE FRINGES OF THE LABOUR MARKET; THE PENSIONERS AND OTHER 
PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER IN THE LABOUR MARKET. 
THIS ALSO MEANS DEMOCRATISING INDUSTRY AND INCREASING WORKERS' 
OWNERSHIP AS WELL AS CONTROL OVER VITAL ECONOMIC RESOURCES AND 
INTRODUCING DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY INTO 
THE WORLD ECONOMIC ORDER, TO ACHIEVE A BETTER NORTH-SOUTH 
GLOBAL BALANCE AND WORLD-WIDE ECOLOGICAL SANITY. 

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

THE RECENT CATASTROPHE IN SOMALIA (RESULTING FROM THE COMBINED 
EFFECT OF FRACTURED CIVIL SOCIETY AND FAMINE) HAS ILLUSTRATED ONCE 
AGAIN THE CONTINUING ANGUISH EXPERIENCED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE 
THIRD WORLD. THE STRUCTURAL INJUSTICE OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC 
RELATIONS IS REFLECTED IN THE ABSURD REALITY THAT THE RESOURCES 
FLOWING FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO THE RICHER NATIONS 
(PRIMARILY INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEBT) EXCEED RESOURCES FLOWING 
THE OTHER WAY (AID ETC.). 
IRELAND'S EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT THE DEHUMANISATION OF 
THE WORLD'S POOR AT UN AND EC LEVEL RING HOLLOW IN VIEW OF THE 
SAVAGE CUTS IN OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE SINCE 1987 UNDER 
FIANNA FAIL AND THE PDS WHICH HAS LEFT US, IN PROPORTIONATE 
TERMS, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OECD LEAGUE TABLE. 
FURTHERMORE, IRELAND'S MEMBERSHIP FEE FOR INTERNATIONAL 
AGENCIES (UN, FAO, WHO ETC.) ARE A 'FIRST CHARGE' ON THE 
MEAGRE AID BUDGET WHICH MEANS THAT THE CORE BILATERAL AID 
PROGRAMME HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY ERODED TO A MERE 10 
MILLION IN 1992. 
DEMOCRATIC LEFT, IN THE NEXT DAIL, WILL WORK ENERGETICALLY 
TOWARDS THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: 
IMMEDIATE RESTORATION OF THE AID BUDGET WE WANT TO SEE IT AT THE 
1987 VALUE, I.E. 0.25% OF GNP AND ACHIEVEMENT OF THE UN 
TARGET OF 0.7% OF GNP WITHIN 7 YEARS. 
RESTRUCTURING THE CHANNELS OF ADMINISTRATION OF THE BILATERAL AID 
PROGRAMME MUST BE IMPROVED TO UTILISE IRISH EXPERTISE MORE 
EFFECTIVELY AND REDUCE AGENCY PROLIFERATION. 
ACCOUNTABILITY   PUBLIC FUNDS GOING TO WORLD BANK AND 
INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES MUST BE CLOSELY MONITORED.
