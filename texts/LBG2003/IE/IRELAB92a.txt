MAKING IRELAND WORK
A TWO-PART PROGRAMME
TO PUT
JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS ...
&
TRUST INTO POLITICS


JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS

IRELAND DESERVES A FRESH START. 
IT MUST BE ABOUT PUTTING JUSTICE BACK INTO ECONOMICS, AND TRUST 
BACK INTO POLITICS-ABOUT MAKING IRELAND WORK AGAIN.
 
THERE ARE MANY CONSTRAINTS. TO USE THE LANGUAGE OF THE RECENT 
AMERICAN ELECTION, "TAX AND SPEND" POLICIES WILL NOT SOLVE OUR 
PROBLEMS NOW. BUT "TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS"-THE POLITICS OF 
GREED AND INDIFFERENCE-IS DEAD. 

TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS IS A SET OF POLICIES WHICH IS BASED ON 
THE BELIEF THAT REMOVING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONTROLS ON FREE 
MARKET FORCES WILL EVENTUALLY BENEFIT EVEN THE MOST DEFENCELESS 
AND VULNERABLE. THIS IS THE APPROACH WHICH HAS MOTIVATED FIANNA 
FAIL AND THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS, SUPPORTED FOR MOST OF THE 
TIME BY FINE GAEL, SINCE 1987. IT HAS BEEN A BETRAYAL OF PEOPLE. 

WE NEED A NEW VISION. 
WE NEED TO TAP INTO THE SPIRIT, THE ENERGY, THE IMAGINATION, THE 
DYNAMISM, AND THE CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT, THAT EXISTS IN ABUNDANCE 
IN OUR COMMUNITY. POLITICIANS NEED TO GROW UP, AND TO FACE 
CHALLENGES WITH THE SAME MATURITY THE PEOPLE SHOW. 

THERE IS ONE ISSUE WITHIN IRELAND, AND ONE ABOVE ALL, WHICH 
DEMANDS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FROM THE ENTIRE POLITICAL SYSTEM, AND 
INDEED FROM THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. 

THAT ISSUE IS UNEMPLOYMENT-AND ITS COUNTERPART, THE CREATION 
FIFTEEN OF EMPLOYMENT. 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE HEART OF OUR SOCIAL PROBLEMS. IT IS AT THE 
HEART OF THE GRINDING POVERTY THAT TOO MANY FAMILIES HAVE TO 
ENDURE. IT IS AT THE HEART OF INEQUALITY. IT IS EATING INTO THE HEART OF 
OUR PEOPLE. ABOVE ALL, IT IS ROBBING THOUSANDS OF HOPE. 

THAT'S WHY THE WHOLE OF THIS DOCUMENT IS DEVOTED TO PUTTING 
JUSTICE BACK INTO THE ECONOMY. 

BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ISSUE. THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND ARE READY. 
READY TO RESPOND TO A NEW VISION. READY TO RE-DISCOVER THAT 
CARING FOR EACH OTHER, HIGH STANDARDS OF SERVICE, PROFIT BASED ON 
ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR, HONESTY AND OPENNESS IN PUBLIC LIFE, CAN BE 
COMPATIBLE. READY TO FIND A NEW SENSE OF PURPOSE, EVEN OF 
EXCITEMENT, IN REBUILDING OUR SOCIETY. 

THE SECOND PART OF OUR PROGRAMME, DEALING WITH THAT ISSUE- THE 
ISSUE OF TRUST IN POLITICS-WILL BE PUBLISHED SEPARATELY. 

BRINGING BACK HOPE IS THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROGRAMME. 
IT DOESN'T PROMISE EASY SOLUTIONS, OR CONTAIN EASY PROMISES. IT IS 
NOT BASED ON ANY ENTRENCHED POSITIONS, OR HOSTILITY TOWARDS ANY 
CONTRIBUTING SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY. BUT IT IS FIRMLY ANCHORED IN 
HUMAN VALUES. 

IT'S ABOUT THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS WORKING TOGETHER; ABOUT 
THE FREEDOM OF INDIVIDUALS TO USE THE MARKET PLACE TO EXERCISE 
CHOICES; ABOUT REBUILDING A MIXED ECONOMY WHERE RIGHTS ARE 
RESPECTED AND GIVEN EXPRESSION. 

WHAT WE ARE DOING IS SETTING GOALS-GOALS FOR OURSELVES, AND FOR 
IRELAND. 
THE MANDATE WE ARE SEEKING IS A MANDATE FOR FUNDAMENTAL 
CHANGE, TO PUT THE VALUES WHICH HAVE MADE IRELAND RESPECTED 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BACK ON OUR OWN AGENDA. 
WE ARE ASKING THE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR A FRESH START. IRELAND WORKS 
BEST WHEN IT WORKS TOGETHER. LET'S WORK TOGETHER-AND MAKE 
IRELAND WORK AGAIN.

DICK SPRING
PARTY LEADER, THE LABOUR PARTY
PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: THE ROLE OF BORROWING

IRELAND VOTED FREELY AND OVERWHELMINGLY FOR THE MAASTRICHT 
TREATY. THAT TREATY SETS PARAMETERS FOR FUTURE BORROWING, AND 
TARGETS TOWARDS WHICH WE MUST AIM. WE HAVE YET TO REACH ALL OF 
THOSE TARGETS -BUT WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, UNLIKE, 
FOR EXAMPLE, GERMANY AND THE UNITED TIED KINGDOM. 

WE HAVE A HEAVY NATIONAL DEBT ALREADY. NO PRUDENT 
GOVERNMENT, WITH THE LONG -TERM INTERESTS OF ITS PEOPLE AT HEART, 
WOULD SET OUT TO INCREASE THAT DEBT BY BORROWING RECKLESSLY TO 
FINANCE DAY-TO DAY SPENDING. 

THESE ARE IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS. THEY CANNOT BE IGNORED. 

THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, AMONG OTHERS, HAS 
ADVOCATED A MASSIVE RE-INVESTMENT PROGRAMME FOR EUROPE-A 
PROGRAMME WHICH IS ESSENTIAL IF EUROPE IS TO COME TO GRIPS WITH 
UNEMPLOYMENT, AND REAP THE BENEFIT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. 

AS PART OF THAT APPROACH, IT HAS ALREADY BEEN PRO POSED, AND IS 
UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMISSION, THAT BORROWING FOR 
INFRASTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE OVERALL 
TARGET PARAMETERS. 
AND THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF AREAS OF PRODUCTIVE INFRASTRUCTURAL 
DEVELOPMENT WHERE CAREFUL AND PRUDENT BORROWING, CAPABLE OF 
PRODUCING AN ECONOMIC RETURN OVER TIME, IS ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED.

IN ADDITION, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WILL ITSELF SUPPORT 
PROJECTS, ON A MATCHING BASIS, FOR WHICH WE WILL HAVE TO SUPPLY 
THE DOMESTIC INVESTMENT (INCLUDING SOME OF THOSE LISTED BELOW). 
THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY INSTANCES WHERE IRELAND HAS FAILED TO 
DRAW ON THIS SUPPORT, SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WERE UNWILLING TO 
MAKE THE INVESTMENT NECESSARY TO ATTRACT THE MATCHING FUNDS. 

IN SHORT, THE STALE AND ORTHODOX APPROACH OF THE LAST FEW YEARS, 
WHICH CONDEMNED MANY GOOD PROJECTS TO OBLIVION OR, AT BEST 
LONG DELAYS, WILL HAVE TO END. 

THERE IS A PLACE FOR CAREFUL BORROWING TO FINANCE INVESTMENT IN 
AN ECONOMY WHICH HAS A STRONG CREDIT RATING, WHOSE BASIC 
ATTRIBUTES ARE SOUND, BUT  WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF REBUILDING TO BE 
DONE. SUCH  BORROWING CAN AND MUST BE UNDERTAKEN IN SUCH A 
WAY AS TO ENABLE THE DEBT/GNP RATIO TO CONTINUE TO FALL, AND WILL 
THEREFORE BE DEPENDENT ON GROWTH AND ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY.

A NEW AND PRUDENT APPROACH WOULD ENABLE WORK TO BEGIN NOW 
ON A HOST OF ESSENTIAL PROJECTS, AND WOULD CREATE THOUSANDS OF 
JOBS IN THE PROCESS- ALL OF THEM PRIORITIES FOR LABOUR, INCLUDING 
THE FOLLOWING: 

LIGHT RAIL FOR DUBLIN

THE TALLAGHT REGIONAL HOSPITAL

NATIONAL SPORTS FACILITIES-A STADIUM, AND A SWIMMING POOL 

OUR DETERIORATING COUNTY ROADS, AND THE NATIONAL PRIMARY 
NETWORK   

INVESTMENT IN ACCESS TRANSPORT BY SEA AND AIR

FURTHER UPGRADING OF OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS 

TOURISM PROJECTS AT REGIONAL LEVEL 

IN ADDITION, LABOUR IS PROPOSING THAT PROJECTS PLANNED FOR 
INCLUSION IN THE PUBLIC CAPITAL PROGRAMME OVER THE NEXT THREE 
YEARS SHOULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD AT AN EVER ACCELERATING PACE. 
SCHOOLS, HEALTH AND COMMUNITY CENTRE PROJECTS, TRAINING CENTRES, 
AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN FACILITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL 
HANDICAP MUST BE BROUGHT FORWARD, AND DELAYS ELIMINATED. 

A NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL SEMI-STATE COMPANIES- AER LINGUS 
AND BORD NA MONA ARE TWO EXAMPLES -CANNOT UNDERTAKE 
COMMERCIALLY SOUND INVESTMENT BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF THEIR 
BALANCE SHEETS. 

THE LABOUR PARTY WOULD PUT EQUITY IN TO STRENGTHEN THEIR BALANCE 
SHEETS, TO FREE THEIR POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING SUBSTANTIAL NEW 
EMPLOYMENT THROUGH PROFITABLE INVESTMENT. 

THIS RESTRUCTURING OF BALANCE SHEETS WOULD NOT AFFECT THE 
ACHIEVEMENT OF THE DEBT CRITERIA SET BY MAASTRICHT, AS THE SEMI-
STATE BORROWING IS ALREADY GOVERNMENT GUARANTEED. 

FINALLY, LABOUR IS PROPOSING A SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC HOUSING 
PROGRAMME, DEALT WITH IN MORE DETAIL LATER. SIGNIFICANT FUNDING 
FOR SUCH A PROGRAMME COULD COME FROM DIVERTING MONEY AWAY 
FROM THE SUBSIDIES PAID TO PRIVATE LANDLORDS FOR INADEQUATE RENTED 
ACCOMODATION FOR THE HOMELESS- £20 MILLION THIS YEAR ALONE BY 
THE EASTERN HEALTH BOARD, FOR EXAMPLE. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: MONETARY POLICY AND INTEREST 
RATES 
IRISH INTEREST RATES ARE FAR TOO HIGH. THEY INHIBIT INVESTMENT, THEY 
DAMAGE OTHERWISE SOUND BUSINESSES, THEY MAKE HOUSING 
UNAFFORDABLE, THEY CREATE HARDSHIP IN FAMILIES. 

THEY MUST BE BROUGHT DOWN. LABOUR HAS ADVOCATED, AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO PURSUE, THE RIGHT MIX OF POLICIES TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. 

OUR TARGET IS TO GET THEM BELOW 10% IN THE SHORT TERM. 

CLEARLY, THE KEY ISSUE IN TERMS OF EUROPEAN POLITICS IS A 
REDUCTION IN GERMAN INTEREST RATES. IRELAND MUST TAKE A LEAD IN 
PERSUADING OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE THAT THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE 
EUROPEAN PRIORITY. WITH ITS UNIQUE STANDING IN THE LARGEST GROUP 
IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, AND IN THE CONFEDERATION OF SOCIALIST 
PARTIES IN EUROPE, LABOUR IS PARTICULARLY WELL-POSITIONED TO FORGE 
ALLIANCES WITH OTHER PARTIES, IN GOVERNMENT AND IN OPPOSITION, IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES TOWARDS THAT END. 

AT HOME, SEVERAL POLICY CHANGES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED: 

• THE RIGHT MIX BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN BORROWING, AND 
THE RIGHT MIX OF CURRENCIES IN WHICH SUCH FOREIGN BORROWING IS 
UNDERTAKEN, WOULD GREATLY EASE THE PRESSURE ON OUR CURRENCY AND 
REDUCE THE NEED FOR HIGHER INTEREST RATES. THE MECHANISMS ARE IN 
PLACE TO CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF OUR BORROWING VIRTUALLY AT A 
MOMENT'S NOTICE-WE NEED TO USE THOSE MECHANISMS FAR MORE 
EFFECTIVELY THAT WE ARE DOING. 

• EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF EXCHANGE CONTROLS, THE CENTRAL BANK HAS 
MANY POWERS AVAILABLE TO IT TO CURB THE EXPORT OF MONEY FOR 
SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. THOSE POWERS, IF USED RIGOROUSLY, WOULD 
MAKE SPECULATION AGAINST THE CURRENCY FAR LESS ATTRACTIVE. 

• THE GOVERNOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK POINTED OUT RECENTLY THAT THE 
RASH OF CURRENCY SPECULATION, ALTHOUGH IT MADE MILLIONS FOR A 
FEW, GENERATED NO WORTHWHILE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WITHIN THE 
ECONOMY. IF TAXATION POLICY WERE GEARED TOWARD SECURING A TAX 
YIELD FROM SUCH SPECULATIVE PROFITS, IT WOULD ACT AS A 
CONSIDERABLE DICINCENTIVE FOR SUCH DAMAGING SPECULATION. 

IN THE SHORT TERM, THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATES ON FAMILIES MUST BE 
EASED. RECENTLY THE GOVERNMENT ALLOCATED A SUM OF FIFTY MILLION 
POUNDS TO HELP BUSINESSES AFFECTED BY THE STERLING CRISIS. IT WAS 
DONE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE DAIL, AND WITHOUT BREACHING 
BORROWING TARGETS. 

• FAMILIES MUST BE HELPED IN THE SAME WAY. 

WE ADVOCATE AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE INTEREST THAT 
CAN BE CLAIMED AS TAX RELIEF, TO 100% OF £5,000 IN THE CASE OF A 
COUPLE, AND 100% OF £2,500 IN THE CASE OF A SINGLE MORTGAGE-
PAYER. WE PROPOSE THAT THIS INCREASE SHOULD LAST UNTIL THE RECENT 
3% INCREASE IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES HAS BEEN FULLY REVERSED. 

PUFFING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: THE CONTRIBUTION OF SOCIAL 
PARTNERSHIP

THE ROLE OF SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN UNDER-VALUED. IT HAS NOT 
BEEN A CHALLENGING PROCESS. IT HAS NOT DRAWN IN THE UNEMPLOYED, 
THE AGENCIES WHO COPE WITH POVERTY, THE WIDER PUBLIC. 

TOO OFTEN, THE IMAGE OF "SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP" THAT IS CONJURED UP 
IN THE PUBLIC MIND IS A PICTURE OF POWERFUL PEOPLE, MEETING IN 
PRIVATE TO SOLVE PAY DISPUTES AND LITTLE ELSE. IT IS NOT AN ACCURATE 
IMAGE, BUT IT HAS INHIBITED THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL PARTNER SHIP FROM 
PLAYING THE ROLE IT COULD PLAY. 

IN SHORT, WE HAVE A GOOD MODEL IN PLACE. BUT IT HAS FAILED TO 
BUILD THE SOLIDARITY NECESSARY IN THE COMMUNITY. 

WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN AND DEEPEN THE MODEL, TO MAKE IT 
INCLUSIVE, AND TO SET IT THE MOST CHALLENGING TARGETS. 

   THAT'S WHY LABOUR PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FORUM.

THE NESF WE PROPOSE WOULD BE FAR MORE INCLUSIVE, FAR MORE 
INDEPENDENT, AND WOULD HAVE GOVERNMENT AS AN EQUAL PARTNER. 

IT WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING KEY INGREDIENTS, MISSING FROM ALL 
PREVIOUS APPLICATIONS OF THE MODEL, AND ESSENTIAL TO ENABLE THE 
FORUM TO FUNCTION DYNAMICALLY AS A CONSENSUS-BUILDING 
APPARATUS: 
IT WOULD BE INCLUSIVE. THE EXISTING SOCIAL PARTNERS WOULD BE 
REPRESENTED, AND SO WOULD THE OIREACHTAS, WOMEN, ORGANISATIONS 
REPRESENTING THE UNEMPLOYED, AGENCIES ENGAGED IN SOCIAL 
ANALYSIS, AND OTHERS. GOVERNMENT WOULD BE A FULL PARTNER. 

THE FORUM WOULD HAVE AN INDEPENDENT CHAIRPERSON, A 
PERMANENT SECRETARIAT, AND A BUDGET TO ENABLE IT TO COMMISSION 
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH. 

• IT WOULD MEET IN PLENARY SESSION IN PUBLIC, AND ENGAGE IN 
SEARCHING ANALYSIS AND DEBATE IN PREPARING ITS REPORTS. 

• EXCEPT WHERE CONFIDENTIALITY IS NECESSARY, AS IN THE CASE OF 
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE BUDGET, ALL MAJOR GOVERNMENT POLICY 
PROPOSALS (INCLUDING GREEN PAPERS) ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
POLICY WOULD BE SUBMITTED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO THE FORUM 
FOR ITS CONSIDERATION. 

THE FORUM THAT WE ENVISAGE WOULD BE A LIVELY, PARTICIPATIVE, 
CHALLENGING AND INFLUENTIAL PROCESS. IT'S TERMS OF REFERENCE 
WOULD NOT BE CONFINED TO THE ISSUE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, BUT WOULD 
COVER A WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ACTIVITY. 

BUT IT WOULD HAVE A SPECIAL TARGET IN RELATION TO UNEMPLOYMENT. 
THE FORUM SHOULD BE SET THE CHALLENGE OF ADDRESSING THE 
POLICY ISSUES, AND BUILDING THE NATIONAL CONSENSUS, AROUND THE 
TARGET OF A REDUCTION IN THE LIVE REGISTER OF 125,000 THROUGHOUT 
THE DECADE. 

ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCH AN AMBITIOUS TARGET WILL REQUIRE A RANGE OF 
ECONOMIC, FISCAL, INDUSTRIAL POLICY, AND LABOUR MARKET 
INTERVENTIONS. 

ABOVE ALL IT WILL REQUIRE A DEDICATED SENSE OF NATIONAL PURPOSE. A 
NATIONAL FORUM WILL BE A MAJOR INSTRUMENT IN SHAPING THAT 
PURPOSE. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: INDUSTRIAL POLICY 

AT EUROPEAN LEVEL 

ONE OF THE CRUCIAL INSTRUMENTS NECESSARY TO TRANSLATE EUROPEAN 
IDEALS ABOUT CONVERGENCE INTO REALITY IS A EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL 
POLICY. LABOUR IS WELL PLACED, AS A RESULT OF ITS ALLIANCE IN 
EUROPE, TO LEAD A CAMPAIGN FOR A EUROPE-WIDE ASSAULT ON 
UNEMPLOYMENT. 

EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL POLICY IN THIS CONTEXT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN TO 
MEAN THE SORT OF DISCREDITED MANDATORY PLANNING REGIME THAT 
PASSED FOR INDUSTRIAL POLICY IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD IN THE 
PAST. NEITHER DOES IT MEAN THE UNFETTERED REGULATION OF INDUSTRIAL 
ACTIVITY BY INDUSTRY ITSELF. 

INSTEAD, THE INDUSTRIAL POLICY THAT IS NECESSARY WOULD INVOLVE A 
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND INDUSTRY, WHERE BOTH SIDES 
RECOGNISE AND UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE OTHER. 

THE ROLE OF EUROPEAN INDUSTRY IN THIS MODEL IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
OF AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH ENCOURAGES GROWTH AND INVESTMENT TO 
DEVELOP ITS COMPETITIVENESS, TO LEAD THE WORLD IN RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT, AND TO PRODUCE AND DELIVER GOODS AND SERVICES OF 
THE HIGHEST QUALITY, USING PRODUCTION METHODS WHICH PRESERVE 
RATHER THAN THREATEN THE ENVIRONMENT. 

THE ROLE OF THE STATE (AND IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT "THE STATE" IS 
THAT UNIQUE MIX OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE EUROPEAN 
INSTITUTIONS) IS TO ENSURE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOCIETY ARE MET, 
BY ENCOURAGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL BASE WHICH WILL 
PROMOTE AND SUSTAIN EMPLOYMENT, MAINTAIN THE SOCIAL SYSTEM, 
AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF ALL CITIZENS. 

THE MODEL OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY THAT WOULD FLOW FROM THESE 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES WOULD BE ONE BASED ON CONSENSUS. IT WOULD 
HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF A NUMBER OF INGREDIENTS: 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BASE OF KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION, TOGETHER 
WITH HIGH STANDARDS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; 

A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE BOTH EFFICIENCY AND 
PROFITABILITY, ON THE ONE HAND, AND PROPER ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE 
OTHER; 

A TAXATION FRAMEWORK TO ASSIST IN PROVIDING INCENTIVES AND IN 
ENSURING THE WISE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH CREATED; 

AND THE BASIC LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT STATE AIDS AND 
TRADE POLICY WERE FAIR AND EQUITABLE. 

ABOVE ALL IT WOULD HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT THERE IS DISADVANTAGE IN 
SOME PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY AT PRESENT, AND IT WOULD HAVE TO 
PROMOTE SPECIAL MEASURES TO COMBAT THAT DISADVANTAGE IN THE 
INTERESTS OF EQUALITY THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. 

IF WE HERE IN IRELAND WERE TO DEMAND THAT THE EUROPE THAT IS 
DEVELOPING EVERY DAY SHOULD START ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF A 
EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL POLICY, IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER ITEMS ON ITS 
AGENDA, WE WOULD BE DOING A SERVICE FOR ALL EUROPEANS, AND 
PARTICULARLY FOR THE IRISH PEOPLE, BOTH SOUTH AND NORTH.

AT NATIONAL LEVEL: 

IRISH INDUSTRIAL POLICY MUST BE ENERGISED, AND QUICKLY. THIS 
ELECTION HOPEFULLY WILL END THE BICKERING BETWEEN MEMBERS OF 
THE GOVERNMENT THAT HAS DISGRACEFULLY HELD UP SOME OF THE 
CENTRAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CULLITON REPORT. WE KNOW THAT 
THE RADICAL CHANGES IN INDUSTRIAL POLICY THAT ARE NEEDED CANNOT BE 
ACHIEVED OVERNIGHT. IT WILL TAKE A MEDIUM TERM PROGRAMME TO 
BUILD UP A STRONG INDIGENOUS MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN IRELAND, 
BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF ADDED VALUE, AND INVOLVING A DYNAMIC 
PUBLIC SECTOR WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH A COMPETITIVE, 
PROFITABLE, QUALITY-CONSCIOUS PRIVATE SECTOR. 

BUT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IS A POLITICAL RECOGNITION NOW THAT OUR 
INDUSTRIAL POLICY TO DATE HAS BEEN A FAILURE, AND A POLITICAL 
COMMITMENT TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF CHANGE. 

LABOUR BELIEVES IN A MAJOR ROLE FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISE; THIS CAN 
FIND EXPRESSION IN STAND ALONE SITUATIONS, IN JOINT VENTURES WITH 
THE PRIVATE AND CO OPERATIVE SECTORS, AND IN OTHER FORMS OF CO-
OPERATION WHERE RISKS ARE SHARED. 

STATE PARTICIPATION MUST NOT BE STRUCTURED SO THAT PUBLIC CAPITAL 
INVESTMENT IN TRADED ENTERPRISE OR IN POTENTIALLY COMMERCIAL 
SITUATIONS STANDS EXPOSED TO MOST OF THE RISKS WHILE OWNERS OF 
THE PRIVATE CAPITAL ARE ALLOWED TO RETAIN OR DISTRIBUTE MOST OF ANY 
PROFITS THAT MAY ARISE. IN PINT-VENTURE SITUATIONS, STATE AND 
PRIVATE CAPITAL MUST BE MUTUALLY REINFORCING ELEMENTS-SHARING 
IN THE BENEFITS AND THE RISKS. 

ENTERPRISE IN THE SENSE OF COMBINING LAND, LABOUR AND CAPITAL INTO 
INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY, AND ADDING THEM ALL TO SKILL AND FLAIR, IS CENTRAL 
TO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE ECONOMY NEEDS MORE-ENTER PRISE; 
PUBLIC, PRIVATE AND CO-OPERATIVE. 

THE STATE, THROUGH COMPANIES AND AGENCIES, HAS AND MUST RETAIN 
A SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY TO GENERATE AND CONTROL TRADED ENTERPRISES 
ON ITS OWN. IT MUST ALSO BE GIVEN AN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENTAL ROLE IN 
CON JUNCTION WITH PRIVATE AND FOREIGN ENTERPRISE. THERE MUST BE 
ADEQUATE REWARD FOR ACHIEVEMENT-COUPLED WITH PENALTIES FOR 
FAILURE. 

FINALLY, THERE MUST BE A REGULATORY ROLE WHICH APPLIES WITH EQUAL 
FIRMNESS AND FAIRNESS TO ALL ENTERPRISES PUBLIC, PRIVATE, 
COOPERATIVE AND MIXED. THE ERA OF SCANDALS MUST COME TO AN END 
-NOW. 

THE SEMI-STATE SECTOR HAS BEEN CLOUDED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
BY SCANDAL. IN THE EYES OF SOME, THE SCANDALS THAT AFFECTED 
GREENCORE AND TELECOM ENHANCED THE CASE FOR PRIVATISATION, AND 
WEAKENED THE ARGUMENT FOR ANY INVOLVEMENT BY THE STATE IN THE 
CREATION OF WEALTH. 

THIS IS A DANGEROUS AND FOOLISH APPROACH. THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN 
IRELAND HAS NOT SHOWN ITSELF TO BE LESS IN NEED OF REGULATION, OR 
LESS PRONE TO SCANDAL. AND IT IS CLEAR TO ANYONE WITH EYES TO SEE 
THAT WE CANNOT RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON THAT SECTOR TO SOLVE THE JOBS 
CRISIS - HISTORY ALONE SHOWS THAT. FURTHERMORE, THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR DOES NOT EVEN CLAIM AN EXPLICIT OBJECTIVE OR RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR JOB CREATION. 

THE ARGUMENT THAT ONLY FREE MARKET FORCES WILL ENSURE GROWTH 
AND EFFICIENCY IS NOT UNIVERSALLY VALID EITHER HISTORICALLY OR IN 
TERMS OF MODERN EXPERIENCE. THE ECONOMIES OF JAPAN, SOUTH 
KOREA AND TAIWAN WERE NOT BUILT ON THIS BASIS OVER RECENT 
DECADES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE GENERALLY BASED ON FREE MARKET 
PRINCIPLES. 

THERE WERE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF PLANNING AND INTERVENTION, MUCH 
STATE OWNERSHIP OF KEY RESOURCES, AND COMMERCIAL DIRECTION OF 
THE BUSINESS SECTOR. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: PRIVATISATION

LABOUR IS OPPOSED TO THE PRIVATISATION OF PUBLIC UTILITIES AND STATE 
COMPANIES IN THE TRADED SECTOR AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE. 

THE THRUST OF LABOUR'S APPROACH TO INDUSTRIAL POLICY IS TO CREATE 
AND RETAIN VALUE ADDED INSIDE IRELAND, AND TO ACHIEVE THIS BY A 
JUDICIOUS MIX OF PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH, STATE PARTICIPATION AND 
APPROPRIATE TAXATION POLICIES. 

LABOUR'S POLICY IS TO ENABLE STATE COMPANIES TO GROW-NOT TO SELL 
THEM OFF TO NATIVE OR FOREIGN INDIVIDUALS, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS 
OR SPECULATORS. 

BECAUSE FIANNA FAIL, FINE GAEL AND THE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS 
ALL SUBSCRIBE IN VARYING DEGREES TO THE NOTION THAT ONLY THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR COULD SAFELY BE ALLOWED CREATE NEW EMPLOYMENT, 
THE ROLE OF STATE COMPANIES AS POTENTIAL "NATIONAL CHAMPIONS" HAS 
NOT BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY. 

YET SOME STRIKING SUCCESSES, SUCH AS AIRMOTIVE AND LATER TEAM, 
SHOWS WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE IN A DISCRIMINATING AND ENTIRELY 
SELECTIVE INDUSTRIAL POLICY. 

A NUMBER OF THE PUBLIC COMPANIES NOW FACE DIFFICULTIES, LARGELY 
AS A RESULT OF THE NEGLECT OF POLICY BY A GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS 
HAD NO INTEREST IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. 

LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO THE PROTECTION OF THESE COMPANIES, AND TO 
PUTTING THEM BACK ON A GROWTH PATH. 
IN THE CASE OF THE CURRENT DIFFICULTIES IN AER LINGUS, THE LABOUR 
PARTY WILL STAND FIRMLY BEHIND THE EFFORTS OF MANAGEMENT AND 
WORKERS IN THE COMPANY TO ADDRESS CURRENT PROBLEMS. WE 
STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT IF ADDITIONAL EQUITY IS REQUIRED AS PART OF A 
PACKAGE OF MEASURES TO REVITALISE A COMPANY WHICH HAS MADE AN 
OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO IRELAND'S DEVELOPMENT, NO NEW 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SHIRK THAT RESPONSIBILITY. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT

LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO SECURING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN IRISH 
JOBS. THE APPROACH WE PUT FORWARD IN 1988 IN "LABOUR'S 
ALTERNATIVE" HAS BEEN MORE THAN VINDICATED BY THE CULLITON 
REPORT. 

• LABOUR WILL PRESS FOR THE SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT OF FORBAIRT, 
AS A SEPARATE COMPANY WITH THE CAPACITY TO INVEST ON A LONG-TERM 
BASIS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIGENOUS ENTERPRISE. IT MUST BE 
ORGANISED SECTORALLY, WITH REGIONAL BOARDS OVERSEEING 
DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR AREAS. 

• BASED ON A FULL REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS EXPANSION SCHEME, TO 
ENSURE THE ELIMINATION OF POTENTIAL ABUSE, WE WOULD PROPOSE TWO 
NEW MEASURES TO MAKE PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT IN  JOBS MORE 
ATTRACTIVE. THE COST OF THESE MEASURES IN TAX FOREGONE WOULD BE 
MORE THAN COMPENSATED BY THE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY GENERATED. 

• LABOUR WOULD SLASH CAPITAL GAINS TAX TO 10% FOR BES 
PROJECTS IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY- PROVIDED THE INVESTMENT IS 
FOR FIVE YEARS, AND RELATED DIRECTLY TO MANUFACTURING. 
ALTERNATIVELY, WE WOULD ALLOW ROLL-OVER RELIEF, PROVIDED THAT THE 
GAINS REALISED ARE RE-INVESTED IN ANOTHER SIMILAR BES PROJECT. 

• LABOUR WOULD RAISE THE CEILING FOR BES PROJECTS FROM 
£500,000 TO £3 MILLION. 

LABOURS ALTERNATIVES IN 1988 DOCUMENT, HAS ALREADY PROPOSED 
THAT A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEE INVESTMENT FUNDS BE ESTABLISHED, 
AND THAT TAX INCENTIVES SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO WORKERS TO INVEST 
SAVINGS IN SUCH FUNDS. THE FUNDS WOULD BE EMPOWERED TO 
INVEST ONLY IN FIRMS OR CO-OPERATIVES IN DESIGNATED SECTORS OF 
NATIVE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY AND TRADED SERVICES. 

THE FUNDS WOULD BE A SUPPLEMENTARY SOURCE OF CAPITAL WITHIN THE 
FRAMEWORK OF POLICY AS EXECUTED BY THE NEW STATE AGENCY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIGENOUS INDUSTRY. 
FORBAIRT WOULD BE EMPOWERED TO BRING INVESTMENT OPTIONS 
TO THE ATTENTION OF THE FUND TRUSTEES AND MANAGERS ON A 
CONTINUING BASIS. 

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH FUNDS, WHICH COULD PROVIDE MANY 
MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR INVESTMENT, 
WOULD REQUIRE A DETAILED LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: TAX, JUSTICE, AND INCENTIVES FOR 
JOB CREATION

THE SINGLE GREATEST PRIORITY IN PERSONAL TAX REFORM IS THE EASING 
OF THE TAX BURDEN ON LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME EARNERS, THROUGH A 
SUSTAINED EXPANSION OF THE STANDARD RATE BAND. 

THE TARGET OF POLICY, TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS FAST AS ECONOMIC 
CONDITIONS ALLOW, AND CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL FINANCIAL 
PARAMETERS OUTLINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, SHOULD BE TO ARRIVE AT A 
POINT WHERE NO SINGLE TAXPAYER EARNING £12,500 PER ANNUM, AND 
NO MARRIED COUPLE EARNING £25,000 PER ANNUM, SHOULD BE 
PAYING MORE THAN THE STANDARD RATE OF TAX. 

THE LEVEL OF PERSONAL ALLOWANCES SHOULD BE INCREASED AS A MEANS 
OF REDUCING THE TAX BURDEN ON THOSE WITH INCOMES UP TO AVERAGE 
INDUSTRIAL EARNINGS. 

CHILD BENEFIT SHOULD BE INCREASED TO £40 PER MONTH PER CHILD. 
THE GOVERNMENT, IN THE PERSON OF THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL 
WELFARE, HAS ALREADY RECOGNISED CHILD BENEFIT AS THE MOST 
EFFECTIVE WEAPON HE HAS IN THE BATTLE AGAINST POVERTY. OF COURSE, 
HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THE OPTIMUM POLICY IS TO REACH 
£40 PER MONTH TARGET BY THE YEAR 1996. THE UNEMPLOYED AND 
THOSE ON LOW INCOMES WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM THIS CHANGE. 

TO HELP PAY FOR THIS CHANGE, CHILD DEPENDENT ALLOWANCES 
SHOULD BE PHASED OUT, AND THE ADULT RATE OF PAYMENT FOR 
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT/ ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE INCREASED, SO THAT 
TOGETHER WITH CHILD BENEFIT INCREASES, THE UNEMPLOYED WITH 
DEPENDANTS WILL BE BETTER OFF. THIS WILL REMOVE THE SO-CALLED 
"POVERTY TRAP". AT PRESENT, FORTY FIVE PER CENT OF CHILDREN IN 
FAMILIES OF FOUR OR MORE HAVE PARENTS OUT OF WORK. THE POVERTY 
TRAP THEY FACE WOULD BE HELPED BY MAKING CHILD PAYMENTS NEUTRAL 
AS TO THE WORK STATUS OF THE PARENTS. 

THE CHANGES MADE BY GOVERNMENT IN RELATION TO THE DIRT TAX 
WILL HAVE TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY RE ASSESSED, IN LIGHT OF THE 
POSTPONEMENT OF THE RATIFICATION OF THE MAASTRICHT TREATY, AND THE 
ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE INCENTIVE FOR PRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT. 

LABOUR WOULD PROPOSE THE INTRODUCTION OF "GREEN TAXES" 
IMPOSED ON ACTIVITIES THAT CAUSE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. THESE 
COULD BE USED TO ENCOURAGE POLLUTERS TOWARDS LESS DAMAGING 
METHODS, TO PRO MOTE ENERGY CONSERVATION, AND TO FUND 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS. 

SHORT TERM TAX MEASURES TO HELP PROMOTE 
EMPLOYMENT CREATION: 

WE WOULD SEE A NUMBER OF IDEAS AS BEING WORTH EXAMINATION, AS 
POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT AND USEFUL IN THE SHORT TERM. WE DO NOT 
ENVISAGE MANY OF THESE IDEAS BECOMING PERMANENT FEATURES OF 
THE TAXATION SYSTEM-RATHER WE SEE THEM AS A RESPONSE TO THE 
EMERGENCY THAT EXISTS. THE PROPOSALS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 

• ADDITIONAL LABOUR COST RELIEF, TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO HIRE 
EXTRA STAFF THROUGH ALLOWING THEM TO OFFSET TWICE THE INCREASE IN 
PAYROLL COSTS AGAINST TAX LIABILITY; 

• TAX CREDITS FOR START-UP BUSINESSES, RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF 
EMPLOYEES HIRED, AND ENABLING EMPLOYERS TO GENERATE PROFITS TO 
THE EXTENT OF THE CREDIT; 

• ROLL-OVER RELIEF FROM CAPITAL GAINS TAX FOR PEOPLE WHO SELL 
BUSINESSES OR PROPERTY, PROVIDED THE PROFIT IS INVESTED IN A NEW 
BUSINESS IN IRELAND. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: LABOUR MARKET INTERVENTIONS

EDUCATION-THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION 

LOW EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT IS PERHAPS THE BIGGEST SUPPLY SIDE 
FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE EXPANSION OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT. 

THE PREVENTION OF FUTURE UNEMPLOYMENT LIES IN A CONCENTRATION OF 
RESOURCES IN EXPANDING THE EXTENT AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION FOR 
THE WHOLE POPULATION, BUT PARTICULARLY FOR SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED 
GROUPS. THIS MUST BEGIN AT PRE-SCHOOL LEVEL FOR THE LATTER. IN 
ADDITION, THERE MUST BE A MORE EMPHASIS ON SECOND-CHANCE 
EDUCATION, TO ENABLE PEOPLE WHO ARE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED TO 
EXPAND THE RANGE OF CHOICES OPEN TO THEM. 

THE OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE TO RAISE THE SCHOOL LEAVING AGE TO 17 
YEARS, AND TO INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF SCHOOL LEAVERS IN THIRD 
LEVEL EDUCATION. 

A SUSTAINED EXPANSION OF EDUCATION FOR VULNERABLE DISADVANTAGED 
CHILDREN WILL IN TIME REDUCE THE FLOW INTO LONG-TERM 
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNDER 25 AGE GROUP. 

GIVEN THE CHRONIC LABOUR SURPLUS WHICH WILL PERSIST UNTIL AFTER 
THE YEAR 2000, AN EXPANSION OF RESOURCES IN EDUCATION IS THE KEY 
STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING THE FUTURE MOBILITY OF LABOUR MARKET 
ENTRANTS TO OTHER E.C. COUNTRIES. 

A NATIONAL LANGUAGE TRAINING PROGRAMME SHOULD BEGIN FOR ALL 
CHILDREN AGED NINE AND UPWARDS TO INCLUDE AT LEAST TWO EUROPEAN 
LANGUAGES OTHER THAN IRISH AND ENGLISH. 
THE EXPANSION OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES MUST BE STATE-LED AND 
FUNDED, WITH AN IMPORTANT ALTHOUGH SUBSIDIARY ROLE FOR THE 
MARKET SECTOR, PARTICULARLY IN LANGUAGE TRAINING. 

THE AIM FOR THE YEAR 2000 SHOULD BE A SHIFT OF RESOURCES TOWARDS 
EDUCATION WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE WORK OPTIONS IN EUROPE FOR ALL 
SCHOOL LEAVERS. OPENING UP MORE CHOICES TO SCHOOL-LEAVERS, HOW 
EVER, SHOULD NOT BE SEEN IN THE SAME LIGHT AS THE RECENT HIDDEN 
POLICY OF ENCOURAGING AS MANY OF OUR SCHOOL-LEAVERS AS POSSIBLE 
TO EMIGRATE. LANGUAGE EDUCATION IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT TO 
OUR FUTURE ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE EUROPEAN MARKETPLACE, AS 
WELL AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIFE SKILLS AND CHOICES OF YOUNG 
PEOPLE. 

JOB PLACEMENT AND TRAINING

A NATIONAL JOB PLACEMENT AND TRAINING SCHEME FOR THE LONG-
TERM UNEMPLOYED IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO REDUCE LONG-TERM 
UNEMPLOYMENT TO APPROXIMATELY 25,000 OVER THE NEXT DECADE. IT 
SHOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING FEATURES: 

TARGETED AT THE FILLING OF ANY VACANCY AND NOT ADDITIONAL 
VACANCIES (AS IN THE NEW EMPLOYMENT SUBSIDY SCHEME); 

CONFINED TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR 12 MONTHS OR 
LONGER OR ARE CURRENTLY ON TRAINING/EMPLOYMENT SCHEME HAVING 
BEEN TWELVE MONTHS OUT OF WORK; 

EMPLOYER SUBSIDIES WHICH ARE REALISTIC: £132 PW IN 1ST YEAR; 
£120 PW IN 2ND YEAR; £120 PW IN 3RD YEAR; £2,500 CASH GRANT TO 
EMPLOYERS RETAINING THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED IN EMPLOYMENT 
FOR A FURTHER MINIMUM PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. 

• HAVE AN AGREED QUOTA OF VACANCIES (25%) RESERVED FOR THE 
UNEMPLOYED IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS BY AGREEMENT WITH 
EMPLOYERS AND UNIONS; 

• ALL LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED TAKEN ON UNDER THE SCHEME TO 
PARTICIPATE IN FAS FUNDED TRAINING WHERE NECESSARY; 

• A NATIONAL PRE-RETURN TO WORK COUNSELLING SERVICE WHICH ALL 
THOSE RECRUITED UNDER THE SCHEME WOULD ATTEND. 

FUNDING FOR A SCHEME ALONG THESE LINES WOULD QUALIFY UNDER THE 
EC STRUCTURAL FUNDS PROGRAMME AND WOULD BE LARGELY SELF-
FINANCING IN THE MEDIUM TERM. 

FAS-A NATIONAL LABOUR MARKET AGENCY 
GIVEN THAT SKILLS TRAINING WILL INCREASE FOR THOSE IN WORK, IT IS 
CRUCIAL THAT FAS RETAIN QUALITY TRAINING PROGRAMMES FOR THE LONG-
TERM UNEMPLOYED. 

BY LINKING TRAINING WITH SUBSTANTIAL JOB PLACEMENT SUBSIDIES, THE 
BALANCE OF DISADVANTAGE WHICH OTHERWISE WILL INCREASE FOR THE 
LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED CAN BE TILTED IN THEIR FAVOUR. 

THE ROLE OF FAS AS THE NATIONAL LABOUR MARKET AGENCY SHOULD 
BE STRENGTHENED ON A REGIONAL BASIS AND EMPLOYERS SHOULD BE 
REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH EACH REGIONAL OFFICE. 

WORK-SHARING: LABOUR'S INITIATIVE IN IRELAND 
THE NATIONAL VOLUNTARY WORK-SHARING SCHEME WE HAVE ALREADY 
PUBLISHED, WHICH AIMS AT CREATING 75,000 ADDITIONAL VACANCIES IN 
THE PERIOD 1993 1995, HAS ALREADY RECEIVED A MEASURE OF SUPPORT 
FROM BOTH EMPLOYER AND TRADE UNION ORGANISATIONS. 

THE SCHEME IS AIMED AT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE AT WORK, THROUGH A 
COMBINATION OF TAX INCENTIVES AND SHORTER WORKING HOURS, TO 
SHARE THEIR JOBS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED. 

THE DETAIL OF THE SCHEME IS READILY AVAILABLE. ELIGIBILITY, THE 
SCOPE OF THE SCHEME, CONDITIONS OF SERVICE, HOLIDAY AND SICK 
LEAVE, SUPERANNUATION, PROMOTION, OVERTIME AND OTHER CONDITIONS 
WOULD BE IN LINE WITH APPROVED EXISTING JOB-SHARING SCHEMES IN 
THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. 

THE POTENTIAL OF THE SCHEME AND ITS TAKE-UP WOULD DEPEND ON THE 
DEGREE TO WHICH GOVERNMENT, EMPLOYERS AND TRADE UNION 
ORGANISATIONS WOULD AGREE TO PROMOTE IT. TO ENSURE A GOOD TAKE-
UP THE COMMITMENT OF EMPLOYERS, GOVERNMENT AND THE ICTU 
WOULD BE ESSENTIAL TO BRING LONGTERM UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN TO 
25,000. THE SPEED OF PROGRESS IN REACHING THIS TARGET WOULD BE 
DETERMINED BY THE EMPLOYMENT GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY AND 
THROUGH OUT THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, BUT ABOVE ALL BY THE 
COMMITMENT OF THE SOCIAL PARTNERS.

HOWEVER, FOR WORK-SHARING TO OPEN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF 
ADDITIONAL VACANCIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION IN 
UNEMPLOYMENT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER THE PERCENTAGE OF THE 
LABOUR FORCE WHICH PARTICIPATES IN WORKSHARING THE GREATER THE 
NUMBER OF VACANCIES ON A NET BASIS, OVER AND ABOVE NEW JOB 
CREATION AND JOB LOSSES, WHICH WILL BE GENERATED. 

CURBING VOLUNTARY REDUNDANCY

THE LABOUR PARTY WORK RE-ORGANISATION SCHEME PUBLISHED IN 
1988 AIMS AT REDUCING VOLUNTARY REDUNDANCIES AND COUNTERING 
THE CASH INCENTIVE FOR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES TO "SELL" THEIR JOBS 
WHEN RATIONALISATION OF COSTS ARE NECESSARY. 

APPROXIMATELY 40-50% OF REDUNDANCIES ARISE IN SITUATIONS OTHER 
THAN THE CLOSURE OF COMPANIES OR REDUCTIONS IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. 

HAD THE GOVERNMENT MADE AVAILABLE THE £120M.. SPENT IN THE 
PERIOD 1987-1990 ON SO-CALLED VOLUNTARY REDUNDANCIES IN THE 
PUBLIC SERVICE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC 
SERVICE THROUGH VOLUNTARY WORK-SHARING COULD BE 15,000 HIGHER 
TODAY AT NO EXTRA COST. AND ADDITIONAL VACANCIES WOULD BE 
AVAILABLE EACH YEAR FOR LABOUR MARKET ENTRANTS. 

WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED IN IRELAND IS A TAX REGIME WHICH GIVES 
EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES A STRONG INCENTIVE TO OPT FOR 
REDUNDANCIES IN THE FACE OF A DOWNTURN IN REVENUE FOR EITHER THE 
GOVERNMENT (PUBLIC SERVICES) OR COMPANIES IN THE MARKET SECTOR. 
THIS IS A VERY RIGID FORM OF RESPONSE WHICH IS TOTALLY 
INAPPROPRIATE WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. 

THE REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS ACTS AND RELATED TAX FREE TREATMENT OF 
REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS WERE INTRODUCED WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT WAS 
RELATIVELY LOW. REDUNDANT WORKERS IN THE 1965 1975 PERIOD IN 
PARTICULAR COULD EXPECT TO BE REEMPLOYED IN A RELATIVELY SHORT 
SPACE OF TIME. THE AVERAGE TIME ON UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT 
INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE 198~1990 PERIOD, WITH A 
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED. 

TOTAL REDUNDANCIES IN THE PERIOD 1980-91 AVERAGED 21,318 PER 
ANNUM. APPROXIMATELY 8-10,000 PER ANNUM WERE DUE TO 
"RATIONALISATION" RATHER THAN CLOSURE. IF THE LEVEL OF REDUNDANCIES 
DUE TO RATIONALISATION HAD BEEN INSTEAD SPREAD ACROSS THE 
REMAINING WORKFORCE THROUGH RE-TRAINING AND REDEPLOYMENT, A 
FAIR PROPORTION OF THAT TOTAL OF 100,00~120,000 JOBS COULD HAVE 
BEEN RETAINED. 

UNEMPLOYMENT, DIGNITY AND CHOICE

FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE, UNEMPLOYMENT MEANS A SENTENCE OF 
ECONOMIC DEATH. IT IS A FACT THAT THE LONGER UNEMPLOYMENT LASTS, 
THE HARDER RE-ENTRY TO THE WORKFORCE BECOMES. 

TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT, THE STRUCTURES AND RULES RELATING TO 
UNEMPLOYMENT COMPOUND THAT PROBLEM. IN PARTICULAR, THE 
REQUIREMENT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE IS ONLY PAYABLE TO 
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED AND AVAILABLE FOR WORK, MILITATES 
AGAINST THE CHANCE OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE PURSUING A RANGE OF 
PERSONAL GOALS. THIS RULE HAS BEEN RELAXED TO SOME EXTENT, IN 
RESPECT OF PART-TIME WORK, VOLUNTARY WORK AND SOME EDUCATION 
COURSES. 

WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE ABOLISHED ENTIRELY. ANYONE WHO IS 
UNEMPLOYED, AND WHO WISHES TO TAKE UP A PROGRAMME OF FURTHER 
EDUCATION (AT WHATEVER LEVEL), OR TO GET INVOLVED IN VOLUNTARY 
WORK IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY, SHOULD BE SUPPORTED, RATHER THAN 
PENALISED. 

PEOPLE WHO OPT FOR THIS FORM OF ACTIVITY CAN BE TAKEN OFF THE LIVE 
REGISTER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY WISH TO RE-ENTER THE WORLD OF 
WORK. 

AT PRESENT, ANYONE UNEMPLOYED MUST SIGN ON ONCE A WEEK. IT IS 
NO LONGER DEAR WHY THIS IS NECESSARY. IT REPRESENTS A 
CONSIDERABLE INDIGNITY FOR THE UNEMPLOYED PERSON, AND INVOLVES 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF STAFF HOURS (INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF 
GARDA HOURS IN RURAL AREAS) IN CARRYING OUT A MEANINGLESS 
EXERCISE. IT IS COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE AGAINST FRAUD. 

THE "WEEKLY SIGNING-ON" CEREMONY SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, AND 
REPLACED BY A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE SIGN ON AT THE START OF A 
PERIOD OF UNEMPLOYMENT, AND OFF AT THE END. THIS WOULD FREE UP 
THOUSANDS OF STAFF HOURS, WHICH COULD BE USED IN TWO WAYS-
FIRST, TO ASSIST IN BETTER DETECTION OF FRAUD, AND SECOND, TO BE USED 
IN BETTER SERVICES FOR THE UNEMPLOYED. 

IN ADDITION, THE PRESENT REQUIREMENT WHEREBY ANY ONE IN RECEIPT 
OF SUPPLEMENTARY WELFARE ALLOWANCE MUST MAKE REGULAR VISITS 
TO THEIR LOCAL HEALTH CENTRE SHOULD ALSO BE ABOLISHED. IT IS A 
DEMEANING REQUIREMENT, ENTIRELY REMINISCENT OF THE WORK-HOUSE, 
WHICH SERVES NO PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO MAKE THE RECIPIENT FEEL 
DEPENDENT AND UNDER CONTINUOUS SCRUTINY BY AN UNFRIENDLY 
BUREAUCRACY. 

ALL SUCH PAYMENTS CAN BE MADE AND PROCESSED THROUGH THE 
EXISTING STATE BANKING MACHINERY, ULTIMATELY USING "CASHLESS" 
METHODS OF PAYMENT. 

THE KEY TO BETTER SERVICES IS THE CONCEPT OF THE "ONE-STOP SHOP". 
THERE IS NO REASON WHY A PER SON WHO IS DEPENDENT ON SOCIAL 
WELFARE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ALL HIS OR HER ENTITLEMENTS, 
AND BE REGISTERED FOR ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT POSSIBILITIES, IN ~E 
SAME LOCATION. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO THE ECONOMY: THE BANKING SYSTEM -
SHOULD WE EXPECT MORE?

LABOUR PROPOSES A DETAILED, THOROUGH, INDEPENDENT EXAMINATION 
OF BANKING PRACTICE, AND OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, 
IN IRELAND. 

SOME YEARS AGO, THE COMMISSION ON TAXATION PUT THE SUBJECT OF 
TAX ON THE TOP OF THE AGENDA. THERE IS A CASE FOR A SIMILAR 
COMMISSION ON THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, WHICH WOULD HAVE AS ITS 
STARTING POINT THE QUESTION "WHAT ROLE SHOULD THE FINANCIAL SECTOR 
PLAY IN A DEVELOPING ECONOMY LIKE THIS?" 

FOR MOST OF US, THE FINANCIAL SECTOR IS A CLOSED AND MYSTERIOUS 
WORLD. THAT MYSTERY OUGHT NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO PREVENT US FROM 
EXAMINING FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES. THE KIND OF ISSUES THAT NEED 
EXAMINATION INCLUDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BANKS AND OTHER 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO, OR INHIBITING, ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT; THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE OPERATING FREE FROM 
ANY EFFECTIVE REGULATION; THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRACTICES MORE 
APPROPRIATE TO CARTELS OR MONOPOLIES ARE ALLOWED TO PASS FOR 
STANDARD BANKING PRACTICE. 

THERE IS, FOR EXAMPLE, AMPLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE BANKS 
OPERATE CREDIT POLICIES WHICH ARE MORE SUITED TO THEIR OWN NEEDS 
THAN TO THE NEEDS OF THE WIDER ECONOMY. WHILE NO-ONE WOULD 
ARGUE THAT THE BANKS SHOULD ENGAGE IN IMPRUDENT OR RECKLESS 
SPECULATION, IT IS NOT GOING TOO FAR TO SUGGEST THAT IN RECENT YEARS, 
IRISH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IN SO FAR AS IT IS DEPENDENT ON THE 
CREDIT POLICIES OF BANKS, HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF POOR INVESTMENT 
POLICIES BY THE BANKS. 

IN SHORT, THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT IRISH CUSTOMERS ARE 
PAYING FOR POOR FOREIGN INVESTMENTS BY  IRISH BANKS. AND ONE 
HAS TO ASK-SHOULD THE IRISH ECONOMY BE PUT IN A SECONDARY 
POSITION TO ADVENTURES THAT DEPEND ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN 
MARYLAND, NEW HAMPSHIRE, OR ANYWHERE ELSE? 

FOR YEARS-ALL OVER THE WORLD-IT HAS BEEN A TRUISM TO SAY THAT 
WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GROWING, THE BANKS OPEN UP FOR CREDIT 
BUSINESS-OFTEN TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO OVER-
HEATING IN THE ECONOMY. BY THE SAME TOKEN, THE BANKS 
TRADITIONALLY BEGIN OPERATING A SQUEEZE ON CREDIT WHEN EVER THE 
ECONOMY SLOWS DOWN. 

AND IN DOING SO, THE BANKS ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO NO ONE BUT THEIR 
OWN SHAREHOLDERS. THERE IS NO NEED FOR THEM TO JUSTIFY, EXPLAIN, 
OR EVEN ADMIT TO A CREDIT SQUEEZE, NO MATTER HOW DAMAGING IT IS 
TO ANY PROSPECTS FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. 

THERE ARE THREE BASIC REASONS FOR THIS: 

• CUSTOMERS HAVE NO EFFECTIVE VOICE; 
• THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE STATUTORY REGULATION;
• THERE IS INADEQUATE COMPETITION. 

BANK CUSTOMERS, WHETHER INDIVIDUAL OR CORPORATE, ARE ENTITLED TO 
LEGAL PROTECTION, AND TO THE ASSURANCE THAT IN ANY CASE WHERE THEY 
FEEL UNFAIRLY OR ARBITRARILY TREATED, THEY WILL HAVE RECOURSE. AT PRE 
SENT, THE CENTRAL BANK WILL INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS BY CUSTOMERS, 
BUT IT IS A PROCEDURE WITHOUT TEETH. 

WE ARE PROPOSING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATUTORY BASIS OF 
REGULATION OR PROTECTION, WHICH WOULD BE EMPOWERED ON AN 
INDEPENDENT BASIS TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS, MAKE 
RECOMMENDATIONS, AND HAVE A RANGE OF SANCTIONS AT ITS DISPOSAL 
TO ENSURE THAT BANK CUSTOMERS ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY. 

A BANKING THIRD FORCE

THE ISSUE OF COMPETITION IN BANKING NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. 
WHILE IT MIGHT BE HOPED THAT THE OPERATION OF A MORE COMPETITIVE 
MARKET ON ITS OWN WILL INDUCE A GREATER AWARENESS OF THE NEEDS 
OF CUSTOMERS AND THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE, THERE IS NOTHING IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE BANKS' OPERATION TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS ANYTHING 
MORE THAN IDEALISTIC. 

THAT IS WHY THE TIME HAS COME TO CONSIDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 
THIRD FORCE IN BANKING. THE STATE RUNS TWO BANKS, ICC AND 
ACC. PART OF THE MANDATE OF THOSE BANKS IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT. 

IN ADDITION, THE STATE HAS CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN THE OPERATION 
OF THE TRUSTEE SAVINGS BANK. AND THE STATE RUNS A NATION-WIDE 
NETWORK OF BRANCH OFFICES, ALL EQUIPPED FOR AT LEAST BASIC BANKING 
PURPOSES, IN AN POST. 

LABOUR PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE BANKING SYSTEM, 
BASED ON A COMBINATION OF ACC, ICC, THE TRUSTEE SAVINGS 
BANKS, AND AN POST, POSSIBLY ON A JOINT VENTURE BASIS WITH A 
MAJOR EUROPEAN BANK. 

SUCH A BANK COULD INITIALLY DRAW SUPPORT FROM THE THOUSANDS OF 
TRANSACTIONS, AND HUNDREDS OF MIL LIONS OF POUNDS, INVOLVED IN 
STATE BUSINESS, RANGING FROM SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS TO 
INVESTMENTS BY SEMI-STATE COMPANIES. IT WOULD OF COURSE HAVE 
TO OPERATE ACCORDING TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF PRUDENTIAL 
BANKING POLICY, BUT IT WOULD ALSO TAKE A MUCH GREATER ACCOUNT OF 
THE ECONOMY IN WHICH IT OPERATED. 

A STATE BANKING SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE A VALUABLE THIRD SOURCE OF 
SAVINGS, CREDIT, AND INVESTMENT. BY ENSURING MORE EFFECTIVE 
COMPETITION, IT WOULD TRANSFORM THE BANKING AND FINANCIAL 
SERVICES SECTORS GENERALLY. AND IT IS IN THE BANKS' OWN INTERESTS 
TO BECOME MORE FULLY INVOLVED IN THE ECONOMY IN WHICH THEIR 
DEPOSITORS AND THEIR BORROWERS, AND INDEED THEIR SHAREHOLDERS 
LIVE. 

AT PRESENT, OF COURSE, THE GOVERNMENT IS PROPOSING THE 
PRIVATISATION OF THE EXISTING STATE BANKS, ICC AND ACC. THIS IS A 
SILLY, SHORT-SIGHTED, AND CAVALIER APPROACH. LABOUR WILL CONTINUE 
TO OPPOSE IT RESOLUTELY. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: JOBS, JUSTICE, AND IMAGINATION

IN 1977 THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED A 3% QUOTA FOR THOSE WITH A 
PHYSICAL OR OTHER DISABILITY FOR EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. 

THE IDEA WAS A RECOGNITION THAT IN THE OPEN LABOUR MARKET AN 
ACTIVE DISCRIMINATION IN FAVOUR OF A GROUP WHICH OTHERWISE 
WOULD EXPERIENCE MASSIVE DISCRIMINATION WAS ESSENTIAL. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS 3% TARGET HAS BEEN HONOURED IN A LARGELY 
TOKEN MANNER. 

ONLY 545 PEOPLE IN 1990 WERE EMPLOYED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICES, 
WHICH OUT OF A TOTAL 179,000 EMPLOYMENT WAS CONSIDERABLY 
BELOW 3%. 

UNEMPLOYMENT AMONGST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES NOW IS 
ESTIMATED AT 80%. THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED FALL INTO THE SAME 
SOCIAL CATEGORY AS THE DISABLED IN THE LABOUR MARKET. THEY ARE OUT 
OF SIGHT AND OUT OF MIND. 

IN PRACTICE, THE DISABILITIES THEY SUFFER FROM ARE SOCIAL-AGE, 
EDUCATION, SOMETIMES HEALTH-RELATED, NUMBER OF DEPENDANTS AND 
LACK OF A RECENT EMPLOYMENT RECORD. 

IN ANY PROGRAMME TARGETED AT THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED, THE 
IRISH GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY IN GENERAL SHOULD FIRST ADDRESS THE 
SHAMEFUL NEGLECT OF THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUP TO 
DISCRIMINATION- THOSE WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITY OR MENTAL 
HANDICAP. THE 3% QUOTA SHOULD BE GIVEN THE PLACE IT WAS 
ORIGINALLY ACCORDED AND MET IN EARNEST. 

THE GOVERNMENT CAN GIVE A LEAD BY HONOURING ITS OWN PLEDGE IN 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR, AND SERIOUS CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO 
LEGISLATION FOR A QUOTA THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY. AT THE VERY 
LEAST, THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE HIGH ON THE AGENDA FOR ANY FUTURE TALKS 
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE SOCIAL PARTNERS. 

JOBS THROUGH OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT AID

IRELAND MUST RECOGNISE THE GROWING PLIGHT OF THE 400 MILLION 
INHABITANTS OF THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA WHO ARE IN DANGER OF 
DROUGHT, FAMINE AND DISEASE WHILE THE COUNTRIES OF THE NORTH 
CONTINUE TO PROS PER. THERE ARE, OF COURSE, MANY COUNTRIES OF THE 
THIRD WORLD OUTSIDE OF AFRICA WHO ALSO NEED KEY PERSONNEL AND 
AID. 

BY INCREASING IRELAND'S COMMITMENT TO ODA FROM THE CURRENT 
SHAMEFUL LEVEL OF 0.2% OF GNP TO 0.7% BY THE YEAR 1996 WE 
COULD PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL TRAINED PERSONNEL FREE OF SALARY COSTS 
TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FOR UP TO 6,000 IRISH PEOPLE. 

THIS WOULD CREATE VACANCIES FOR THE PERIOD THESE PERSONNEL WERE 
EMPLOYED IN THE THIRD WORLD AND MAKE A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
THIRD WORLD. WE ALREADY HAVE AGENCIES IN PLACE WITH THE SKILLS 
NECESSARY TO TRAIN AND PLACE PEOPLE IN THE THIRD WORLD. ALL THEY 
LACK ARE THE RESOURCES. 

THERE ARE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILLING TO 
VOLUNTEER FOR THIS WORK. INCENTIVES SHOULD BE PUT IN PLACE TO 
MAKE IT A PRACTICAL PROPOSITION. NO-ONE UNDERTAKING SERVICE IN 
THE THIRD WORLD SHOULD LOSE OUT IN THE SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM, 
FOR INSTANCE, AND THERE SHOULD BE A GUARANTEE OF FURTHER EDUCATION 
FOR ANYONE RETURNING HOME IF THEY WANT IT. 

AS A FIRST STEP, THE AGENCY FOR PERSONAL SERVICE OVERSEAS SHOULD 
BE ASKED TO PRODUCE AN URGENT STUDY ON HOW WE COULD CONTRIBUTE 
PERSONNEL AND EXPERTISE IF THE RESOURCES WERE PUT IN PLACE TO DO 
IT. DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA COULD BE AS READILY FUNDED IF 
INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESS WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO RECOGNISED 
THIRD WORLD AGENCIES, WORKING IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT, WERE ABLE TO REGARD SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS AS TAX 
DEDUCTIBLE. 

THE COMBATTING OF CRIME

ONE OF THE MOST WORRYING FEATURES OF MODERN IRELAND IS THE 
UPSURGE IN CRIME. ESPECIALLY IN OUR CITIES AND TOWNS, THERE ARE 
INCREASING FEARS AMONG OLD PEOPLE AND PEOPLE LIVING ALONE. 
DRUG-RELATED CRIME, AND CRIMES INVOLVING ILLEGALLY HELD WEAPONS, 
ARE A PARTICULARLY FRIGHTENING FEATURE. 

IN ADDITION, THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED 
WHITE COLLAR CRIME IS ON THE INCREASE IN IRELAND. 

CHANGES IN LAWS AND IN POLICING TECHNIQUES ARE NECESSARY TO 
COUNTERACT BOTH OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS. BUT IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, 
THERE IS ONLY ONE EFFECTIVE MEASURE TO PROVIDE THE REASSURANCE 
THAT PEOPLE NEED IN THE FACE OF RISING CRIME. 

LABOUR WOULD PROPOSE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GARDAI 
PROGRESSIVELY OVER A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME, BY 2,000, 
INCLUDING THE RECRUITMENT OF A NUMBER OF PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE TO 
ASSIST IN THE FIGHT AGAINST FRAUD AND WHITE COLLAR CRIME GENERALLY. 
THIS WILL BE DONE BY A COMBINATION OF RECRUITMENT, 
REDEPLOYMENT, AND BETTER UTILISATION OF EXISTING RESOURCES. 

OBVIOUSLY, SERIOUS REGARD WILL HAVE TO BE PAID TO THE PUBLIC 
EXPENDITURE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS STEP, AND RECRUITMENT WILL BE 
DETERMINED AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT BY THE AVAILABILITY OF 
RESOURCES. 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IRISH FILM INDUSTRY
. 
LABOUR WILL BE PUBLISHING A SEPARATE POLICY PAPER ON THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF AN IRISH FILM INDUSTRY, USING GRANTS AND TAX 
INCENTIVES. 

THE EMPLOYMENT CONTENT IN FILM IS VERY HIGH. BUT THE INDIRECT 
BENEFITS THAT HAVE FLOWN FROM FILMS LIKE MY LEFT FOOT", "THE 
FIELD", "THE COMMITMENTS" AND "HEAR MY SONG", IN TERMS OF 
THE PROMOTION OF IRELAND ABROAD, ARE IMMEASURABLE. 

AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FILM INDUSTRY WILL HAVE ENORMOUS 
DOWNSTREAM BENEFITS FOR THE ARTS GENERALLY IN IRELAND. WRITERS, 
ACTORS, MUSICIANS, AND A WHOLE HOST OF PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE IN THE 
TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF FILM ARE ALREADY HIGHLY RESPECTED ABROAD, AND 
UNDER-UTILISED AT HOME. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: THE FOOD INDUSTRY

WHILE A GREAT DEAL OF GOVERNMENT TIME HAS BEEN TAKEN UP WITH 
PRIVATISATION LEGISLATION, THE FAILURE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ONE REAL 
ATTEMPT TO ACTIVELY PROMOTE ON A SELECTIVE BASIS THE GROWTH OF A 
LARGE INDIGENOUS MANUFACTURER MAY HAVE PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS 
FOR THE PROSPECTS OF THE CULLITON REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN 
THIS REGARD BEING IMPLEMENTED BY ANY GOVERNMENT IN THE FORESEE 
ABLE FUTURE. 

THE FOOD INDUSTRY, AND IN PARTICULAR THE DAIRY CO-OPS, HAS A LONG 
WAY TO GO BEFORE IT IS TRANSFORMED INTO BUSINESSES OF SUFFICIENT 
SCALE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, AND TO THRIVE IN EUROPE. 

WHILE THE IDA HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN COMPANY DEVELOPMENT 
PROGRAMMES SINCE 1985 WITH A NUMBER OF FOOD COMPANIES, THE 
CRITICAL ISSUE OF REACHING THE MINIMUM TURNOVER THRESHOLD OF TWO 
BILLION POUNDS TO COMPETE IN EUROPE HAS NOW BEEN PUT ON THE 
BACK BURNER. WHILE MERGERS AMONG FOOD CO OPERATIVES IN FRANCE 
AND HOLLAND HAVE PREPARED THEM FOR THE SINGLE MARKET, THE IRISH 
FOOD INDUSTRY IS STILL NOT FULLY READY TO EXPLOIT THE OPPORTUNITIES, 
AND TO BUILD ON IRELAND'S REPUTATION AS A "GREEN" PRODUCER. 

THERE IS A SERIOUS DANGER THAT THE DISTRACTION OF A GREAT DEAL OF 
GOVERNMENT ENERGIES IN PRIVATISATION OF PART OR ALL OF THE 
REMAINING STATE ASSETS MAY SEE A NEGLECT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
EVEN ONE LARGE INDIGENOUS FOOD COMPANY. THE CULLITON REPORT'S 
APPARENT URGING OR ENCOURAGEMENT FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE 
FOOD INDUSTRY WOULD APPEAR TO BE AT BEST A SECOND BEST STRATEGY 
IN ADDRESSING THIS DILEMMA. 
A SMALL NUMBER OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING GREENCORE AND THE 
DAIRY CO-OPS, NOW REPRESENT THE BEST OPTION AS INDIGENOUS FOOD 
COMPANIES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP INTO IRISH INTERNATIONAL 
FOOD COMPANIES. 

WHAT IS URGENTLY NEEDED IS AN INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT PLAN WHICH 
CLEARLY SPELLS OUT TO THE CO-OPS THAT STATE SUPPORT WILL BE SUPPLIED 
TO ENCOURAGE SUPPORT OF MERGERS AMONG THEM IN RESPECT OF THEIR 
EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. 

COMPETITION POLICY CONSIDERATIONS WOULD RESTRICT THEIR 
DEVELOPMENT IF APPLIED IN A MECHANISTIC FASHION. BUT THE REFORMS 
CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED OF CAP PRICE SUPPORTS SHOULD IF 
ANYTHING SPEED UP THE PROCESS. 

IT IS SOMEWHAT ALARMING THAT THE CULLITON REPORT, EXCELLENT IN SO 
MANY OTHER RESPECTS, COMES TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEED FOR 
FOREIGN ACQUISITION OF IRISH FOOD COMPANIES AS A MEANS OF 
SECURING MARKET OUTLETS FOR IRISH FOOD PRODUCTS. 

WHILE EMPLOYMENT MAY TO SOME EXTENT BE STABILISED IN THE FOOD 
INDUSTRY, LONG TERM EXPORT OF PROFITS BY OUR FOOD INDUSTRY WOULD 
BE A FEATURE OF SUCH ACQUISITIONS. 

LABOUR BELIEVES THAT ONE OF THE FIRST RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
FORBAIRT SHOULD BE THE DRAWING UP A BLUEPRINT FOR THE FOOD 
INDUSTRY IN CONSULTATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE MAJOR INTERESTS 
IN THE SECTOR. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: THE TOURISM INDUSTRY 
OUR TOURISM INDUSTRY HAS A GREAT DEAL OF UNREALISED POTENTIAL. IT 
NEEDS A RANGE OF POLICY MEASURES TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO 
TOURISM GROWTH, WHICH INCLUDE THE SEASONALITY FACTOR, 
PROFITABILITY THAT IS TOO LOW, AND A LIMITED RANGE OF TOURISM 
PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE NECESSARY INVESTMENT IN ACCESS 
INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS TO BE MADE. 

ABOVE ALL, TOURISM NEEDS A PLAN. A NATIONAL TOURISM PLAN 
SHOULD NOT BE HANDED DOWN FROM ON HIGH. ITS DEVELOPMENT 
SHOULD INCLUDE THE INDUSTRY AS EQUAL PARTNERS, AND IT SHOULD BE 
ADDRESSED AS MUCH AT MOTIVATING THE INDUSTRY AS AT SOLVING 
IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS. 

LABOUR PROPOSES THE PUBLICATION OF A GREEN PAPER ON THE 
TOURISM INDUSTRY, LEADING TO WIDE SPREAD CONSULTATION WITH THE 
INDUSTRY PRIOR TO THE PUBLICATION OF A DEVELOPMENT PLAN IN THE 
FORM OF A WHITE PAPER. 

MORALE IN THE INDUSTRY IS LOW, AS A DIRECT RESULT OF GOVERNMENT 
POLICIES WHICH HAVE PAID LIP SERVICE TO TOURISM, BUT HAVEN'T 
ACTUALLY BEEN SUPPORTIVE AT ALL. THE FRAGMENTATION OF STATE 
INVOLVEMENT, AND THE UNDERMINING OF STRUCTURES VITAL TO CO-
ORDINATED DEVELOPMENT, HAVE BEEN FEATURES OF THE LAST FEW YEARS.
 
AN INDUSTRY WHICH CONTRIBUTES 7% OF GNP, WHICH PROVIDES 
THOUSANDS OF JOBS, AND WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO THE BALANCE OF 
PAYMENTS, CANNOT BE IGNORED ANY LONGER. 

THE KEY COMPONENTS OF A NATIONAL PLAN MUST INCLUDE THE 
FOLLOWING INGREDIENTS: 
• INCREASED RESOURCES FOR MARKETING, INCLUDING EC SUPPORT;
• WAYS OF ATTRACTING AND FINANCING NEW INVESTMENT; 
• TRAINING; 
• RESEARCH; 
• THE NEED FOR TAX INCENTIVES; 
• THE NEED TO MAKE IRISH TOURISM MORE AFFORDABLE TO VISITORS, 
PARTICULARLY IN SUCH AREAS AS ACCESS AND INTERNAL TRAVEL. 

CLEARLY, CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE REQUIRED. IN 
ORDER TO ENCOURAGE MORE PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT, CONSIDERATION 
MUST BE GIVEN TO THE FOLLOWING 

• RE-INTRODUCTION OF A MODIFIED BES SCHEME; 
• DESIGNATION OF AREAS WHERE TOURISM IS OF CENTRAL ECONOMIC 
IMPORTANCE; 
• MORE ATTRACTIVE CAPITAL ALLOWANCES. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS: HOUSING

OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE FF/PD COALITION HAS SYSTEMATICALLY 
CUT COUNCIL HOUSE BUILDING TO AN ALL TIME LOW. AT PRECISELY THE 
SAME TIME, PRIVATE HOUSE PRICES HAVE ROCKETED. IT NOW TAKES AN 
ANNUAL INCOME OF £22,000 A YEAR TO AFFORD THE AVERAGE HOUSE 
PRICE IN IRELAND, £25,500 PER ANNUM TO AFFORD THE AVERAGE HOUSE 
PRICE IN DUBLIN. 

THIS IS THE AFFORDABILITY TRAP. THE GAP BETWEEN COUNCIL 
HOUSE BUILDING, AND AFFORDABLE PRIVATE HOUSES, HAS NEVER BEEN 
WIDER IN THE RECENT HISTORY OF THIS STATE. 

ON AVERAGE, A MERE ONE THOUSAND COUNCIL HOUSES PER YEAR HAVE 
BEEN BUILT AT A TIME WHEN THE OFFICIAL WAITING LIST STANDS IN EXCESS 
OF TWENTY THOUSAND AND THE REAL HOUSING LIST IS CLOSER TO THIRTY 
THOUSAND PEOPLE-AND GROWING RAPIDLY. 

ANNUAL COUNCIL HOUSE BUILDING UNDER THE FF/PD COALITION IS 
CURRENTLY ONLY ONE FIFTH OF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL FIGURE FOR THE LAST 
TWENTY-FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND AVERAGE PRIVATE HOUSE PRICES HAVE 
RISEN IN THE LAST THREE YEARS: 

FROM £40,000 IN 1987 TO £63,000 NOW IN DUBLIN; FROM 
£37,900 IN 1987 TO £51,600 NOW IN IRELAND AS A WHOLE. 

NEW COUNCIL HOUSE BUILDING HAS COME TO A VIRTUAL STANDSTILL IN ALL 
OUR MAJOR CITIES. TO TAKE JUST ONE EXAMPLE OUT OF THE MANY 
AVAILABLE, DUBLIN CITY HAS OVER 4,000 FAMILIES ON THE WAITING 
LIST. IN 1989 THE CORPORATION BUILT A MERE SIX NEW HOUSES. IN 
1990 ONLY 35 HOUSES WERE BUILT. THE NUMBER INCREASED SLIGHTLY, 
TO 95, IN 1991, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN ONLY 32 COMPLETIONS SO FAR 
THIS YEAR. 

LABOUR DEMANDS THAT AT A MINIMUM, NEW HOUSING STARTS IN THE 
PUBLIC SECTOR SHOULD BE QUADRUPLED IMMEDIATELY, TO 4,000 A 
YEAR. OVER TIME, THE TARGET FOR HOUSE BUILDING MUST BE SUCH AS TO 
ELIMINATE WAITING LISTS. IT IS A SCANDAL AND A TRAGEDY THAT WE 
SHOULD HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN TO TACKLE A HOUSING CRISIS THAT 
HAD ALMOST DISAPPEARED-BUT START WE MUST. 

WITH NEARLY 7,000 COUNCIL HOUSES WITHOUT A BATH ROOM OR INDOOR 
TOILET, OUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE AMONG THE WORST LANDLORDS IN THE 
COUNTRY. MANY LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE RENTING HOUSES WHICH ARE 
STATUTORILY UNFIT. THEY ARE OFTEN RENTED TO ELDERLY TENANTS AND THEIR 
VERY EXISTENCE IN 1992 IS A NATION AL SCANDAL. THE FF/PD 
COALITION GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED A TOTALLY INADEQUATE SUM TO 
MEET THIS URGENT PROVISION. AT THE PRESENT MEAN RATE OF FUNDING, 
IT WILL TAKE OVER THIRTY YEARS TO PROVIDE THESE BASIC SANITARY 
FACILITIES. 

AS A COMMUNITY WE CANNOT ASK ANY COUNCIL TENANT -ESPECIALLY 
AN ELDERLY TENANT-TO WAIT UNTIL THE YEAR 2020 BEFORE HE OR SHE 
CAN AVAIL OF A SIMPLE BATHROOM AND AN INDOOR TOILET. PROVIDING 
SUCH BASIC BATHROOM AND TOILET FACILITIES IS A HOUSING PRIORITY FOR 
THE LABOUR PARTY. 

LABOUR BELIEVES THAT THERE MUST BE A FIVE TO TEN YEAR CRASH 
PROGRAMME TO ELIMINATE THIS SCANDAL. 

THE MAIN FIANNA FAIL CONTRIBUTION TO COUNCIL HOUSING WAS TO 
BUILD THE SO-CALLED 'LOW-COST" HOUSES SO FAVOURED BY THE THEN 
FIANNA FAIL MINISTERS. IN FACT, THEY BUILT OUR BIGGEST HOUSING 
DISASTER. TODAY, THOUSANDS OF TENANTS AND TENANT PURCHASERS ARE 
BEING ASKED TO PAY HALF THE COST OF REPAIRING THESE FIANNA FAIL 
HOUSING MISTAKES. TO THEM, THE "LOW COST" HOUSE IS PROVING A 
VERY EXPENSIVE MISTAKE. 

THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES HAVE BEEN SOLD COUNCIL HOUSES WITH BASIC 
STRUCTURAL FAULTS. THEY BOUGHT THEIR HOMES IN GOOD FAITH WITH 
HARD-EARNED MONEY, BELIEVING THEM TO BE STRUCTURALLY SOUND. 

THEIR HOUSES ARE NOW PROVEN TO BE STRUCTURALLY DEFECTIVE. 
TYPICAL FAULTS RANGE FROM DEFECTIVE CHIMNEYS TO FAILURE OF 
STRUCTURAL PANELS, FROM FAILURE OF WATERPROOF JOINTS TO FAULTY 
ROOFS. LABOUR IN GOVERNMENT STOPPED THE BUILDING OF '10W 
COST" LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSES. THROUGH DESIGN COMPETITIONS AND 
THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF IMPROVED COUNCIL HOUSE DESIGN, LABOUR 
BUILT INSTEAD THE HIGH QUALITY COUNCIL HOUSES WHICH HIGHLIGHTED 
OUR 1982-87 TERM IN OFFICE. 

 LABOUR WANTS AN ALL-PARTY AGREEMENT ON A STRUCTURAL GUARANTEE 
SCHEME FOR ALL PURCHASED COUNCIL HOUSES. 

PUTTING JUSTICE INTO THE ECONOMY: GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES AND 
JOBS

THE TASK OF PUTTING JUSTICE INTO THE ECONOMY, WHICH IS SPELLED 
OUT HERE, MUST BE COMPLEMENTED BY A NEW SENSE OF URGENCY AT 
GOVERNMENT LEVEL. IT IS NO LONGER ENOUGH FOR A MONTHLY 
GOVERNMENT STATEMENT ACCOMPANYING THE LIVE REGISTER FIGURES, 
OR FOR OCCASIONAL ANNOUNCEMENTS OF PACKAGES OF COSMETIC 
MEASURES, TO SUBSTITUTE FOR GOVERNMENT ACTION. 

STEADY PROGRESS TOWARDS THE GOALS IN THIS DOCUMENT REQUIRE A 
TOTAL EFFORT. 

WE ARE CALLING FOR THE CREATION OF A NEW DEPARTMENT OF ENTERPRISE 
AND EMPLOYMENT. IT WOULD HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THE ACTION 
ASPECTS OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY, INCLUDING PLANNING, THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF NEW PLANS FOR INDIGENOUS INDUSTRY, ENERGY POLICY, AND FOR 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LABOUR MARKET MEASURES OUTLINED HERE. 

THE REGULATORY ASPECTS OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY (INCLUDING THE 
MONITORING OF EC FUNDS ALLOCATED TO INDUSTRIES SUCH AS THE FOOD 
INDUSTRY), AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND 
PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION, WOULD ALSO BE VESTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
ENTERPRISE AND EMPLOYMENT. 

IN ADDITION, THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE CHARGED WITH THE 
PROMOTION OF CONSENSUS IN INDUSTRY (AT NATIONAL LEVEL AND ON THE 
SHOP FLOOR), WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPETITION IN EVERY SECTOR 
OF ENTERPRISE, AND WITH CONSUMERS' RIGHTS. 

THIS NEW DEPARTMENT WILL BE ORDERED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE 
DEPARTMENTS OF FOOD AND MARINE, IN DRAWING UP THE MOST 
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN EVER SEEN IN IRELAND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES, UNDERPINNED BY, AND RECONCILED WITH, A 
TOTAL COMMITMENT TO CONSERVATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE 
POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE FOOD, FISHERIES, AND ENERGY SECTORS 
HAS NEVER BEEN FULLY TAPPED. 

SECONDLY, WE ARE SEEKING THE CREATION OF A SPECIALIST DEPARTMENT 
OF TRADE. THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS DEPARTMENT WOULD BE 
SELLING IRISH GOODS ABROAD. 

WE WANT A RADICAL NEW FOCUS. INSTEAD OF MARKETING ALONE, 
STRUCTURES AND INCENTIVES NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT 
THERE ARE MORE IRISH SALESMEN IN THE FIELD TO INCREASE THE EXPORT 
SALES OF IRISH GOODS IN ALL WORLD MARKETS. 

WHILE THE PROMOTION AND MARKETING OF IRISH GOODS IN EXPORT 
MARKETS HAS BEEN AN APPROPRIATE EMPHASIS IN IRISH TRADE POLICY 
OVER THE YEARS, THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF HIGHLY-
MOTIVATED, LANGUAGE-TRAINED, HANDS-ON SALESMEN IN EXPORT 
MARKETS SELLING IRISH GOODS AND SERVICES. THE NEW FOCUS AND 
PRIORITY OF THIS POLICY, BACKED UP BY TOP LEVEL POLITICAL SUPPORT, 
MUST BE TO OVERCOME THIS DEFICIENCY. 

THESE TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS WOULD REPLACE THE EXISTING 
DEPARTMENTS OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE, LABOUR, AND ENERGY. A 
RE-ORIENTATION OF THE STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT WOULD GIVE A 
MUCH NEEDED IMPETUS AND CONCENTRATION TO THE TASK OF PROMOTING 
AND DEVELOPING THE SORT OF ECONOMIC DRIVE WE NEED. 

THE MINISTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE DEPARTMENTS WOULD CARRY 
ULTIMATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND 
IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY -A SITUATION THAT IS TOTALLY LACKING 
NOW. 

SUCH A RE-ORIENTATION WOULD ALSO PROVIDE A REAL FOCUS FOR 
BROADENING THE SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP MODEL WHICH IS NOW IN PLACE. 
IT IS INTEGRAL TO ALL OUR PROPOSALS THAT UNIONS, EMPLOYERS, 
FARMERS, WOMEN, AND THE UNEMPLOYED SHOULD HAVE A REAL SAY, AS 
OF RIGHT, IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY, GLOBALLY AND 
IN THE WORKPLACE. 

APPENDIX

<<<TABLE HERE>>>

1. THE PROGRAMME INVOLVES AN INCREASE IN EXCHEQUER BORROWING 
FOR CAPITAL PURPOSES OF
£200 MILLION IN 1993 (INCLUDING EQUITY CAPITAL FOR STATE 
ENTERPRISES). 

2.  THE EBR WILL RISE TO £974 MILLION IN 1993 BECAUSE ECONOMIC 
GROWTH WILL REMAIN WEAK DUE TO HIGH INTEREST RATES UNTIL MID 
1993, THOUGH WILL BE HIGHER THAN THE 1% PROJECTED GROWTH 
WITHOUT ANY STIMULUS.

3. A FALL IN GERMAN INTEREST RATES OF 2% IS FORECAST TO TAKE PLACE 
IN THE SECOND HALF OF 1993 (WHICH IS A CONSERVATIVE VIEW) 
LEADING TO AN ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH OF 1.25%-
1.5% PER ANNUM IN EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR. 

4. IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE DEFLATIONARY BUDGETARY STANCE IN 
ECONOMIES OTHER THAN ITALY AND GERMANY WILL BE REVERSED IN 
1994 AND THAT THE FAVOURABLE TRADING CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN 
STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOWER INTEREST RATES. 

5. THE CURRENT BUDGET DEFICIT INCREASES IN 1993 BECAUSE OF 
EXISTING COMMITMENTS AND HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT ARISING FROM 
RETURNED EMIGRANTS REDUCING THE IMPACT OF LABOUR MARKET 
MEASURES, AND FALLS IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS TO YIELD A SMALL SURPLUS 
IN 1996. 

6. THE RECOVERY IN THE U.K. ECONOMY IN 1994 HALTS THE INCREASE 
IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND BEGINS TO FALL IN 1995. 

7. THE EBR FALLS BACK TO 2.1% OF GNP IN 1995, WHICH IS A 
CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE, AS THE CUR RENT DEFICIT BENEFITS FROM A £100 
MILLION REDUCTION PER ANNUM IN 1994 AND 1995 FROM THE 2% 
REDUCTION IN GERMAN INTEREST RATES. 

8. THE DEBT/GDP RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE MAASTRICHT TREATY DOES 
NOT INCREASE IN 1993 AND FALLS IN 1994 AND 1995.






              TRUST INTO POLITICS


LAST WEEK WE PUBLISHED THE FIRST PART OF OUR PROGRAMME TO PUT 
JUSTICE INTO ECONOMICS, AND TRUST INTO POLITICS.

THE COST OF THE VARIOUS MEASURES PROPOSED HERE, IN THE SECOND 
PART OF OUR PROGRAMME, HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITHIN THE OVERALL 
FINANCIAL PARAMETERS WE PUBLISHED THEN.

THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OF THIS PART OF THE PROGRAMME IS TO SPELL 
OUT A RANGE OF MEASURES
AIMED AT RESTORING TRUST TO POLITICS. WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE, WE 
HAVE REPEATED SOME OF THE PROPOSALS WE PUT FORWARD IN THE 
ECONOMIC PART OF OUR PROGRAMME.

 TRUST HAS BEEN SHATTERED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. 
THE ERA OF SCANDALS HAS LED TO A DEMAND FOR BETTER AND MORE OPEN 
GOVERNMENT. THE ERA OF BROKEN PROMISES HAS OPENED UP A 
MANDATE FOR MORE HONEST GOVERNMENT. AND THE ERA OF RUN-DOWN 
ESSENTIAL SERVICES HAS CREATED A CRYING NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE, 
AND MORE SOCIALLY JUST, GOVERNMENT.

THIS DOCUMENT IS AIMED AT ADDRESSING THOSE NEEDS. IT SETS OUT, 
WITHIN VERY TIGHT FINANCIAL PARAMETERS, TO REDRESS SOME AT LEAST OF 
THE INJUSTICES THAT HAVE ARISEN FROM GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN THE 
LAST FIVE YEARS. IT AIMS AT ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR 
GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS THAT WILL NEVER BETRAY THE TRUST OF THE 
PEOPLE.

AND IT LAYS OUT AN AGENDA FOR RADICAL REFORM OF OUR LAWS AND 
INSTITUTIONS, TO DEVELOP OUR COMMITMENT TO THE SPIRIT OF 
PARTNERSHIP THAT WE BELIEVE IRELAND WANTS.

BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF RESOURCES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ANY 
RESPONSIBLE PARTY TO LAY OUT A LIST OF FINANCIAL PROMISES AND 
COMMITMENTS. TO ATTEMPT TO DO SO WOULD NOT BE CREDIBLE, AND 
WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE.

FOR THAT REASON, WE HAVE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE MOST OF THE 
LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED IN OUR BUDGET ON TWO 
PRINCIPAL AREAS, BOTH CRYING OUT FOR TRUST AND JUSTICE.

 OUR PRIORITIES ARE CHILDREN, AND PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY. WE 
INTEND TO SPEND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON THESE AREAS NEXT YEAR, 
AND WE ARE NOT APOLOGISING TO ANYONE FOR THE COMMITMENTS WE 
ARE MAKING.

THE FIRST TWO SECTIONS OF THIS PROGRAMME SET OUT OUR PROPOSALS IN 
RELATION TO THESE TWO AREAS OF POLICY.

IF TRUST IN POLITICS MEANS ANYTHING, IT MEANS DIRECTING POLICY 
TOWARDS THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE. VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN 
OUR SOCIETY HAVE BEEN MADE VICTIMS OF POLICY NEGLECT IN THE LAST 
FEW YEARS. WE ARE GOING TO REVERSE THAT TREND

IN RELATION TO THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THIS PROGRAMME, BOTH POLICY 
AND ACTION IS BASED ON A COMMITMENT TO RIGHTS.

THE RADICAL PROGRAMME OF LEGISLATIVE REFORM THAT WE ARE 
PLANNING, ACROSS THE WHOLE RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, IS 
UNDERPINNED BY OUR COMMITMENT TO EQUALITY, AND TO THE DIGNITY 
OF CITIZENSHIP.

THE FULL EXPRESSION OF CITIZENSHIP INVOLVES RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL 
AS RIGHTS. WE BELIEVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY GOES HAND IN HAND WITH 
PARTNERSHIP - AND THAT THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE POLITICS OF 
PARTNERSHIP CAN BRING A NEW ENERGY TO OUR COMMUNITY, AND A 
NEW LEVEL OF TRUST TO OUR POLITICS.

   

DICK SPRING
LABOUR LEADER



               THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE
                 WITH A DISABILITY


IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE RIGHT OF EQUAL CITIZENSHIP 
THAT ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE HAS BEEN SINGLED OUT FOR PARTICULAR 
PRIORITY IN THIS PROGRAMME - PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY.

FOR TOO LONG, THE ISSUE OF DISABILITY IN IRELAND HAS BEEN SEEN AS 
AN ISSUE OF CHARITY - NOT OF RIGHTS. WE RECOGNISE THE DISABILITIES 
FROM WHICH PEOPLE SUFFER, AND WE WANT TO HELP  BUT WE DO NOT 
RECOGNISE OFTEN ENOUGH THE .ABILITIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE, IF ONLY THE 
FACILITIES EXISTED TO BRING THEM TO FULL EXPRESSION.

 WE WANT TO CHANGE THE FOCUS, TO CONCENTRATE ON ABILITY, AND TO 
BRING CITIZENSHIP TO ITS FULL FLOWERING.

PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY ARE EQUAL CITIZENS OF IRELAND. BUT THE FULL 
EXPRESSION OF THAT CITIZENSHIP REQUIRES THE UTILISATION OF 
COMMUNITY RESOURCES, AND A SIGNIFICANT INJECTION OF POLITICAL WILL.

THE NEGLECT OF POLICY IN THIS AREA HAS DIMINISHED THE EQUAL 
CITIZENSHIP OF PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY. THERE IS NOW A MAJOR 
SCANDAL IN REGARD TO ACCESS TO SERVICES; QUALITY OF SERVICES; 
FACILITIES AND ENVIRONMENT; AND WORTHWHILE EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES.

THERE ARE REASONS FOR THIS - AND THEY ALL HAVE TO DO WITH THE 
CHOICES MADE BY GOVERNMENT. LABOUR WOULD MAKE DIFFERENT 
CHOICES. IN A TIME OF SCARCE RESOURCES, LABOUR BELIEVES THAT THE 
AREA OF DISABILITY MUST BE SINGLED OUT FOR SPECIAL PRIORITY.

MENTAL HANDICAP

THE REASONS FOR THE DIMINUTION OF CITIZENSHIP FOR PEOPLE WITH A 
MENTAL HANDICAP INCLUDE:

FUNDING: THERE IS NO SINGLE IDENTIFIABLE FORM OR SOURCE OF 
FUNDING FOR SERVICES. MANY OF THE AGENCIES IN THE FIELD, AS A 
RESULT, HAVE NO CLEAR IDEA OF HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON DIFFERENT

ASPECTS OF THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, AND VERY LITTLE PLANNING IS 
POSSIBLE. THE CAPITAL AND CURRENT MONEY AVAILABLE IS GROSSLY 
INADEQUATE.

STAFF: STAFFING REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE SUBJECT TO THE PUBLIC 
SERVICE EMBARGOES OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. NEARLY EVERY FACILITY IN 
IRELAND IS UNDERSTAFFED (MORE SO IN DUBLIN THAN IN OTHER PARTS OF 
THE COUNTRY).

MANAGEMENT. THERE ARE DOZENS OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES IN THE FIELD. 
COMPETITION IS AS MUCH A FEATURE OF THE SYSTEM AS CO-OPERATION. 
THERE IS WASTE OF RESOURCES ARISING FROM THIS, AND IT IS A HUGE 
OBSTACLE TO PROPER PLANNING.

PHILOSOPHY: THE PROVISION OF SERVICE IS NOT BASED ON A COHERENT 
PHILOSOPHY, AIMED AT DRAWING OUT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL. SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS BELIEVE SINCERELY THAT PEOPLE 
WITH A MENTAL HANDICAP ARE INCAPABLE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT 
DEVELOPMENT; OTHERS BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO TARGET THEY CANNOT 
REACH.

PLANNING: MOST OF THE SERVICE AGENCIES ARE UNABLE TO PLAN BEYOND 
THE END OF A CURRENT YEAR. MANY OPERATIONS ARE BEING RUN ON A 
VERY AD HOC BASIS AS A RESULT.

CONTROL: THERE IS NO ONE PERSON OR AGENCY WITH OVERALL CONTROL 
OF, AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR, THE PROVISION OF A FULL RANGE OF 
SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL HANDICAP. SEVERAL GOVERNMENT 
DEPARTMENTS ARE INVOLVED AND DOZENS OF AGENCIES. THE BUCK 
STOPS NOWHERE. THAT IS THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF ALL

AS A RESULT OF ALL THIS, THERE IS NOW A CRISIS FOR THE 25,000 PEOPLE 
WITH A MENTAL HANDICAP IN IRELAND, AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THAT 
CRISIS MAY RELATE TO EDUCATION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT, OR 
RESIDENTIAL CARE - DEPENDING ON FAMILY AND INDIVIDUAL 
CIRCUMSTANCES.

 BUT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE IN ANY CIVILISED COUNTRY THAT THOSE WHO ARE 
OFTEN UNABLE TO ARGUE THEIR OWN CASE SHOULD BE THE ONES MOST 
VICTIMISED.



LABOUR INTENDS TO PUT A STOP TO THIS. OUR PROPOSALS INCLUDE:

THE PROVISION OF £25 MILLION NEXT YEAR (ALREADY INCLUDED IN OUR 
BUDGET), TO "CATCH UP" ON THE "NEEDS AND ABILITIES" REPORT 
PREPARED BY THE LAST GOVERNMENT AND EFFECTIVELY SHELVED.

THE ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION TO PUT THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH A 
MENTAL HANDICAP ON A STATUTORY BASIS, TOGETHER WITH A MEANS OF 
REDRESS FOR PEOPLE WHOSE RIGHTS ARE IGNORED.

MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THE PARENTS AND FAMILIES OF PEOPLE WITH A 
MENTAL HANDICAP ARE ADEQUATELY CONSULTED AND INVOLVED IN THE 
PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES.

MEASURES TO ENSURE GREATER CO-OPERATION AMONG THE AGENCIES 
INVOLVED, IN SUCH AREAS, FOR EXAMPLE, AS THE ASSEMBLING OF 
FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION, AND IN THE MOST RATIONAL AND 
EFFECTIVE USE OF TRANSPORT FACILITIES.

RE-CLASSIFICATION OF SPECIAL NATIONAL SCHOOLS, AS JUNIOR AND SENIOR 
SCHOOLS, TO RECOGNISE THE FACT THAT STUDENTS ATTEND SUCH SCHOOLS 
UP TO THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE. OVER TIME, THE EQUIPPING 
OF ALL SUCH SCHOOLS TO THE SAME STANDARDS AS ALL PRIMARY AND 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS.

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE FOR PEOPLE WITH 
A MENTAL HANDICAP ON THE CAMPUS OF ONE OF OUR UNIVERSITIES. 
THIS WILL BE A PILOT PROJECT, WHICH WILL SERVE TWO PURPOSES: 
FIRST, THERE IS NO REASON WHY PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL HANDICAP 
SHOULD NOT BE INTEGRATED INTO THE LIFE OF A THIRD LEVEL EDUCATIONAL 
ESTABLISHMENT. THE TRAINING THAT MANY UNDERGO IS ITSELF A FORM OF 
THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT IN CENTRES 
THAT ARE ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD.

SECONDLY, THE RANGE OF DISCIPLINES AVAILABLE IN A UNIVERSITY CAN 
ONLY BENEFIT FROM INTERACTION WITH PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL 
HANDICAP. THE ADAPTATION OF MACHINERY, THE DESIGN OF PRODUCTS, 
MARKETING, ENGINEERING - ALL OF THESE TOGETHER WITH A HOST OF 
"CARING" DISCIPLINES, INCLUDING SPEECH THERAPY, PSYCHOLOGY, 
SOCIAL WORK, ETC - ALL PROVIDE IMPORTANT AREAS OF ACTIVITY AND 
INTERACTION. IN THIS SENSE, THE TRAINING CENTRE WOULD ACT AS A 
RESEARCH RESOURCE AS WELL AS A MECHANISM FOR FURTHER INTEGRATION.

PHYSICAL AND SENSORY DISABILITY

PEOPLE WITH A PHYSICAL DISABILITY HAVE THE SAME TALENTS AND 
ABILITIES AS ANYONE ELSE - THEY ARE EQUAL CITIZENS. THEY ALSO SUFFER 
FROM POLICY NEGLECT. A MAJOR PROGRAMME OF IMPROVEMENTS IS 
NECESSARY.

LABOUR PROPOSES:

A MAJOR PROGRAMME OF DEVELOPMENT OF ACCESSIBLE STREETS AND 
PUBLIC BUILDINGS: STANDARDS WOULD BE PREPARED IN RELATION TO SUCH 
AREAS AS DROPPED KERBS, SAFE CROSSINGS, ON-STREET PARKING 
FACILITIES, SIGNAGE AND STREET FURNITURE.

 ACCESS TO TRANSPORT: ALL FUTURE REPLACEMENT STOCK IN THE PUBLIC 
TRANSPORT FLEET TO INCLUDE AN EMPHASIS ON ACCESSIBILITY; TRAIN AND 
BUS STATIONS TO BE TOTALLY ACCESSIBLE. THIS WILL INVOLVE CAPITAL 
EXPENDITURE OVER THE MEDIUM TERM.

 DETAILED EXAMINATION OF A SCHEME TO PROVIDE AN ALLOWANCE TO 
PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY TO EMPLOY A PERSONAL ASSISTANT, IN CASES 
WHERE THEY REQUIRE HELP AT HOME TO MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE. SUCH 
A SCHEME COULD BE HIGHLY COST-EFFECTIVE, ESPECIALLY WHEN 
COMPARED WITH THE COST OF HOSPITALISATION.


EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY

IN 1977 THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED A 3% QUOTA FOR THOSE WITH A 
PHYSICAL OR OTHER DISABILITY FOR EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. 
THE IDEA WAS A RECOGNITION THAT IN THE OPEN LABOUR MARKET AN 
ACTIVE DISCRIMINATION IN FAVOUR OF A GROUP WHICH OTHERWISE 
WOULD EXPERIENCE MASSIVE DISCRIMINATION WAS ESSENTIAL.

UNFORTUNATELY, THIS 3% TARGET HAS BEEN HONOURED IN A LARGELY 
TOKEN MANNER. ONLY 545 PEOPLE IN 1990 WERE EMPLOYED IN THE 
PUBLIC SERVICES, WHICH OUT OF A TOTAL 179,000 EMPLOYMENT WAS 
CONSIDERABLY BELOW 3%.

UNEMPLOYMENT AMONGST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES NOW IS 
ESTIMATED AT 80%. GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY IN GENERAL MUST FIRST 
ADDRESS THE SHAMEFUL NEGLECT OF THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUP TO 
DISCRIMINATION - THOSE WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITY OR MENTAL 
HANDICAP. THE 3% QUOTA MUST BE GIVEN THE PLACE IT WAS 
ORIGINALLY ACCORDED AND MET IN EARNEST.

THE GOVERNMENT CAN GIVE A LEAD BY HONOURING ITS OWN PLEDGE IN 
THE PUBLIC SECTOR, AND SERIOUS CONSIDERATION MUST BE GIVEN TO 
LEGISLATION FOR A QUOTA THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY. AT THE VERY 
LEAST, THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE HIGH ON THE AGENDA FOR ANY FUTURE TALKS 
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE SOCIAL PARTNERS.

A MINISTER FOR THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY

THE PROGRAMME THAT WE INTEND IS ONE THAT WILL REQUIRE TOTAL 
CONCENTRATION, AND A CONSIDERABLE RE-ARRANGEMENT OF RESOURCES. 
THE EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF SERVICES WILL REQUIRE NEW STRUCTURES, A 
FAR GREATER DEGREE OF CO-ORDINATION, AND STRONG MANAGEMENT.

IT WILL BE A FUNDAMENTAL PRIORITY FOR LABOUR THAT ANY NEW 
GOVERNMENT ELECTED IN IRELAND SHOULD DESIGNATE A MINISTER WITH 
SPECIAL AND

OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY. 
THAT MINISTER MUST BE A FULL MEMBER OF THE CABINET, AND MUST BE 
GIVEN A BUDGET WHICH IS COMMENSURATE TO THE TASK.


             CHILDREN'S ALLOWANCE


A CORNERSTONE OF ANY PARTNERSHIP IN IRELAND IS A NEW CONCERN FOR 
FAMILIES AND FOR INDIVIDUALS: A CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN 
UNDERMINED.

WHERE FAMILIES ARE CONCERNED, OUR POLICIES ON CHILDREN'S 
ALLOWANCE ESPECIALLY WILL BE GEARED TOWARDS RECOGNISING THE 
STRAINS OF NURTURING AND PROVIDING FOR CHILDREN. 93% OF ALL 
MONEY SPENT ON CHILD BENEFIT GOES TO FAMILIES WITH AN INCOME OF 
£25,000 OR LESS. THE AIM OF OUR POLICY IS TO USE THAT MONEY AS 
WISELY AS POSSIBLE, SO THAT IT IS AVAILABLE TO MOTHERS PARTICULARLY 
WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST.

LABOUR HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED A MAJOR PLAN TO USE CHILD BENEFIT 
- OR THE CHILDREN'S ALLOWANCE, AS IT IS STILL POPULARLY KNOWN - TO 
REMOVE POVERTY TRAPS AND TO ASSIST FAMILIES.

THE CHILDREN'S ALLOWANCE, PAYABLE AS IT IS TO EVERY FAMILY, IS 
ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY. IT 
HAS BEEN VERY BADLY NEGLECTED, AND EFFECTIVELY FROZEN SINCE A 
LABOUR PARTY MINISTER INCREASED IT BY 25% IN 1986.

AS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS OUR PLANNED TARGET OF £40 PER MONTH PER 
CHILD, WE HAVE PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY £40 MILLION IN OUR 
FINANCIAL PARAMETERS TO FUND A 25% INCREASE NEXT YEAR.

 THIS WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF £4.20, TO BRING THE CHILDREN'S 
ALLOWANCE TO £20 PER MONTH PER CHILD.

 FROM 1994, WE WILL PROVIDE FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ENHANCED 
PAYMENT FOR CHILDREN OVER 12, AS RECOMMENDED BY THE COMBAT 
POVERTY AGENCY AND THE COMMISSION ON SOCIAL WELFARE.


    HEALTH & SOCIAL
           POLICY


HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE HAVE BEEN THE CASUALTIES OF THE 
DISCREDITED THATCHERITE/ MONETARIST POLICES ADOPTED IN 1989 BY 
THE FIANNA FAIL/ PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT COALITION.

TOP RATES OF INCOME TAX HAVE BEEN REDUCED, ON THE ONE HAND, 
AND SPENDING ON IMPORTED GOODS AND INVESTMENT OF WEALTH 
OFFSHORE HAS INCREASED, ON THE OTHER. A GOLDEN CIRCLE HAS 
EMERGED.

 AND WHILE THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING, HEALTH CARE HAS BECOME AN 
INCREASING FEATURE OF THE TWO-TIER SOCIETY, AND ESSENTIAL SUPPORTS 
FOR THE POOR AND DISADVANTAGED HAVE BEEN DECIMATED.

THE FIANNA FAIL/PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT RECORD IS LITTERED WITH 
BROKEN PROMISES. NO-ONE WILL NOW BELIEVE EITHER CHARLIE 
MCCREEVY'S LAST MINUTE CONVERSION TO COMPASSION AND JUSTICE 
FOR THOSE ON SOCIAL WELFARE, OR DR. JOHN O'CONNELL'S PROMISES 
OF NEW HOSPITALS IN EVERY MARGINAL CONSTITUENCY.

LABOUR'S PRIORITIES IN THESE TWO KEY AREAS ARE:

TO HALT THE DOWNWARD TREND IN SOCIAL EXPENDITURE UNDER THE LAST 
GOVERNMENT.

 TO INTRODUCE A CAREFULLY BALANCED PROGRAMME OF CAPITAL 
EXPENDITURE IN HEALTH CARE AND IN GIVING FULL EXPRESSION TO THE 
RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH A DISABILITY.

 TO CONTINUE WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS IN EFFICIENCY IN BOTH HEALTH 
AND SOCIAL WELFARE PIONEERED BY LABOUR IS SUCCESSIVE 
GOVERNMENTS.

 TO RESTORE JUSTICE, CONCERN AND DIGNITY TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE 
STATE TREATS EVERY MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY, IRRESPECTIVE OF INCOME.

THE INCREASES IN SOCIAL WELFARE AND HEALTH EXPENDITURE MUST BE 
UNDERTAKEN WITHIN OUR GENERAL STRATEGY, WHICH ACCEPTS THE 
MAASTRICHT FRAMEWORK, AND ALL OF THE MEASURES OUTLINED HERE AS 
PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET PUBLISHED IN "JUSTICE 
INTO ECONOMICS" LAST WEEK

IT IS WORTH RECORDING SEVERAL ENCOURAGING FEATURES ABOUT THE 
FINANCIAL SCENE IN HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE.

CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF STERLING HAS DRAMATICALLY REDUCED THE COST 
OF OUR DRUGS BILL. LABOUR WILL ENSURE THAT THESE BENEFITS ARE 
PASSED ON FULLY TO THE GENERAL MEDICAL SERVICE, THE HEALTH 
BOARDS, THE HOSPITAL SECTOR AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THE BRITISH DEVALUATION WILL BE TO REDUCE 
INFLATION TO VERY LOW LEVELS.

THIS WILL LEAD TO A STABILISATION OF BOTH HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE 
COSTS BELOW THE LEVELS CURRENTLY BEING PLANNED FOR.

WELL PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE IN THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE 
AREA, AS WELL AS PROVIDING DESPERATELY NEEDED FACILITIES, WILL ALSO 
PROVIDE CONSIDERABLE ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT; SO THAT EVERY 
POUND SPENT WILL HAVE A DOUBLE EFFECT.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE TALLAGHT HOSPITAL WILL PROVIDE 1,000 EXTRA JOBS 
DURING CONSTRUCTION OVER FOUR TO FIVE YEARS WITH AN INVESTMENT OF 
£140M.

INCREASES IN SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS ARE UTILISED ALMOST ENTIRELY 
IN LOCAL EXPENDITURE ON FOOD, CLOTHING AND SO ON.

THIS GIVES ADDED SUPPORT TO THE LOCAL RETAIL SECTOR, THUS 
IMPROVING GENERAL EMPLOYMENT AND AGAIN GIVING EXTRA EFFECT FOR 
EVERY POUND SPENT.

FF/PD PROMISES AND REALITY:
LABOUR'S POLICIES

THE PROMISE: TO REDUCE HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS THE REALITY: IN 
1989 THERE WERE 22,380 PEOPLE WAITING FOR ESSENTIAL HOSPITAL 
TREATMENT. NOW THERE ARE 36,421 PEOPLE WAITING FOR ESSENTIAL 
HOSPITAL TREATMENT. (SOURCE: DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH STATISTICS)

 LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO MORE EMPHASIS ON PREVENTION AND 
PRIMARY CARE, THUS TREATING ILLNESS BEFORE IT GETS TO THE HOSPITAL 
STAGE. RE-OPENING SOME OF THE BEDS RECENTLY CLOSED, AS WELL AS 
THE PROPOSED CAPITAL PROGRAMME, WILL ENABLE WAITING LISTS TO BE 
REDUCED.

£20 MILLION HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR THIS NEXT YEAR WITHIN OUR 
FINANCIAL PARAMETERS.

THE PROMISE: FIANNA FAIL PROMISED CASH GRANTS TO REDUCE EAR, 
NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) SURGERY WAITING LISTS. THE REALITY: THE 
MONEY HAS BEEN DIVERTED TO OTHER AREAS OF HEALTH AND NO 
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ON ENT LISTS. (SOURCE: 
LEADING ENT SURGEON QUOTED IN IRISH MEDICAL NEWS, NOVEMBER 
1992).

 LABOUR, BY IMPROVING CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CARE AS A PRIORITY 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WOULD ENSURE SPEEDY TREATMENT FOR ALL 
MAJOR HOSPITALISATION PROCEDURES FOR CHILDREN, INCLUDING ENT.

THE PROMISE: TO START BUILDING THE NEW TALLAGHT HOSPITAL 
(PROMISE GIVEN IN 1987, 1989, 1991 AND 1992). THE REALITY: 
WHILE £11 MILLION HAS ALREADY BEEN SPENT ON SITE WORKS, 
PLANNING ETC., NO ACTION HAS YET BEEN TAKEN. THE TALLAGHT 
HOSPITAL BOARD HAS NOT MET FOR NINE MONTHS - AND IT HAS ONLY 
NOW BEEN FORMALLY NOTIFIED OF THE TAOISEACH'S RECENT 
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WORK ON THE HOSPITAL WILL COMMENCE!

 LABOUR IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING £20 MILLION IN NEXT YEAR'S 
PUBLIC CAPITAL PROGRAMME FOR WORK TO COMMENCE.

THE PROMISE: TO PROVIDE PERMANENTLY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE 
ETHOS AND ETHICAL VIEWS OF THE ADELAIDE HOSPITAL IN THE MOVE TO 
TALLAGHT. THE REALITY: NEGOTIATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED ON 
THIS ISSUE. THE HOSPITAL BOARD IS DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT LACK OF 
EFFECTIVE ACTION BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE HOSPITAL'S BUDGET HAS 
BEEN CUT DRASTICALLY.

 LABOUR WILL FULLY PROTECT THE PROTESTANT ETHOS OF THE ADELAIDE AT 
EVERY LEVEL OF THE STRUCTURES FOR THE NEW HOSPITAL, AND THE 
SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL.

 LABOUR, AS STATED, WOULD HAVE A PUBLIC TIMETABLE FOR THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAPITAL PROGRAMME IN HEALTH. WE WILL 
COMPLETE THE RATIONALISATION OF THE DUBLIN HOSPITAL SECTOR BEGUN 
WHEN LAST IN GOVERNMENT. WE WILL FOLLOW EXPERT VIEWS ON THE 
TYPE, SIZE AND LOCATION OF HOSPITAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY TO ENSURE A PLANNED AND INTEGRATED SERVICE WITHIN EASY 
REACH OF EVERY CITIZEN.

THE PROMISE: TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS IN THE GENERAL MEDICAL 
SERVICE. THE REALITY: LARGE NUMBERS OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS ARE 
THREATENING TO RESIGN FROM THE SERVICE ON DECEMBER 8TH WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS PREVARICATED, DELAYED AND CHANGED ITS MIND ON 
THE MATTER.

 LABOUR ACCEPTS THAT THE GP SERVICE IS CRUCIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF EFFECTIVE PRIMARY AND COMMUNITY CARE AND TO PREVENTING 
UNNECESSARY AND EXPENSIVE PRIMARY HOSPITAL FACILITIES. WE WOULD 
IMMEDIATELY ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE DOCTORS' UNIONS ON 
THIS MATTER. MORE RESOURCES MUST BE DEVOTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF EFFICIENT GROUP PRACTICES AND TO PROVIDING A BETTER FUNDED OUT-
OF-HOURS SERVICE. AN APPEALS COMMITTEE WITH ICGP AND IMO 
MEMBERSHIP SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO DECIDE UPON DISAGREEMENTS 
BETWEEN GPS AND GMS. THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD ALSO, AS A FIRST 
PRIORITY, REVIEW AND RE-DESIGN ALL FORMS ISSUED BY THE GMS TO 
GPS AND SHOULD SIMPLIFY THE SYSTEM TO CUT DOWN THE INORDINATE 
AMOUNT OF TIME NOW SPENT BY GPS IN PAPERWORK RATHER THAN 
PATIENT CARE. NECESSARY CHANGES OR ADJUSTMENTS IN THE TAX 
STRUCTURE, TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF CASH FLOW SITUATIONS IN GENERAL 
PRACTICE, WOULD BE EXAMINED SYMPATHETICALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF 
OVERALL TAX REFORM AS IT APPLIES TO ALL THE PROFESSIONS AND THE SELF-
EMPLOYED.

LABOUR WILL ALSO:

DEVOTE £10 MILLION NEXT YEAR (AS PER OUR FINANCIAL PARAMETERS) TO 
EASING THE PRESENT SITUATION IN HEALTH BOARDS, AND TO ALLOW THEM 
TO CONCENTRATE ON WAITING LISTS.

DEVOTE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO A MEANINGFUL PROGRAMME OF 
COUNSELLING AND CARE FOR HIV AND AIDS SUFFERERS.

LEGISLATE TO ALLOW CONDOMS TO BE SOLD IN VENDING MACHINES.

REPLACE THE GLOSSY BUT SUPERFICIAL PATIENTS CHARTER WITH A 
PROPERLY STRUCTURED SYSTEM OF PATIENTS' RIGHTS. WE WILL EXTEND 
THE REMIT OF THE OMBUDSMAN TO COVER PATIENTS' RIGHTS, AND WILL 
ENACT LEGISLATION TO GIVE PATIENTS A RIGHT TO THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS 
IN ANY SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THEY HAVE 
BEEN HURT OR DAMAGED BY MEDICAL TREATMENT.

SOCIAL WELFARE

THE DICKENSIAN APPROACH OF THIS GOVERNMENT TO THE SOCIAL 
WELFARE SYSTEM HAS BEEN INTENSELY DAMAGING TO THE FABRIC OF OUR 
SOCIETY. IT HAS BEEN BASED ON A BLIND AND CALLOUS ASSUMPTION THAT 
THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND WILL TOLERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TWO-TIER 
SYSTEM.

PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON SOCIAL WELFARE ARE NOT LESS 
DESERVING MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. THEY HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT TO 
HUMAN DIGNITY AS ANY OTHER CITIZEN.

LABOUR PROPOSES:

 TO REVERSE THE CUTS MADE BY THE OUTGOING MINISTER WITHIN TWELVE 
MONTHS.

TO INSIST ON A LONG-TERM POLICY COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING THE 
SOCIAL INSURANCE SYSTEM.

 TO ASK THE COMMISSION ON SOCIAL WELFARE TO "RE-VISIT" ITS 
REPORT, AND TO ADVISE THE GOVERNMENT ON ALL REMAINING STEPS TO 
BRING THAT REPORT INTO IMPLEMENTATION.

TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT WILL PREVENT FUTURE MAVERICK 
MINISTERS OF SOCIAL WELFARE FROM REGULATING THE CONDITIONS UNDER 
WHICH POORER PEOPLE MUST LIVE BY MINISTERIAL ORDER.

       UNEMPLOYMENT, DIGNITY, & CHOICE

FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE, UNEMPLOYMENT MEANS A SENTENCE OF 
ECONOMIC DEATH. IT IS A FACT THAT THE LONGER UNEMPLOYMENT LASTS, 
THE HARDER RE-ENTRY TO THE WORKFORCE BECOMES.

TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT, THE STRUCTURES AND RULES RELATING TO 
UNEMPLOYMENT COMPOUND THAT PROBLEM. IN PARTICULAR, THE 
REQUIREMENT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE IS ONLY PAYABLE TO 
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED AND AVAILABLE FOR WORK, MILITATES 
AGAINST THE CHANCE OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE PURSUING A RANGE OF 
PERSONAL GOALS.

THIS RULE HAS BEEN RELAXED TO SOME EXTENT, IN RESPECT OF 
OCCASIONAL VOLUNTARY WORK AND SOME EDUCATION COURSES.

 WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE ABOLISHED ENTIRELY. ANYONE WHO IS 
UNEMPLOYED, AND WHO WISHES TO TAKE UP A PROGRAMME OF FURTHER 
EDUCATION (AT WHATEVER LEVEL), OR TO GET INVOLVED IN VOLUNTARY 
WORK IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY, SHOULD BE SUPPORTED, RATHER THAN 
PENALISED.

PEOPLE WHO OPT FOR THIS FORM OF ACTIVITY CAN BE TAKEN OFF THE LIVE 
REGISTER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY WISH TO RE-ENTER THE WORLD OF 
WORK.

AT PRESENT, ANYONE UNEMPLOYED MUST SIGN ON ONCE A WEEK. IT IS 
NO LONGER CLEAR WHY THIS IS NECESSARY.

IT REPRESENTS A CONSIDERABLE INDIGNITY FOR THE UNEMPLOYED 
PERSON, AND INVOLVES THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF STAFF HOURS 
(INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF GARDA HOURS IN RURAL AREAS) IN CARRYING 
OUT A MEANINGLESS EXERCISE. IT IS COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE AGAINST 
FRAUD.

 THE "WEEKLY SIGNING-ON" CEREMONY SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, AND 
REPLACED BY A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE SIGN ON AT THE START OF A 
PERIOD OF UNEMPLOYMENT, AND OFF AT THE END. THIS WOULD FREE UP 
THOUSANDS OF STAFF HOURS, WHICH COULD BE USED IN TWO WAYS FIRST, 
TO ASSIST IN BETTER DETECTION OF FRAUD, AND SECOND, TO BE USED IN 
BETTER SERVICES FOR THE UNEMPLOYED.

 IN ADDITION, THE PRESENT REQUIREMENT WHEREBY ANYONE IN RECEIPT 
OF SUPPLEMENTARY WELFARE ALLOWANCE MUST MAKE REGULAR VISITS 
TO THEIR LOCAL HEALTH CENTRE MUST ALSO BE ABOLISHED. IT IS A 
DEMEANING REQUIREMENT, ENTIRELY REMINISCENT OF THE WORK-HOUSE, 
WHICH SERVES NO PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO MAKE THE RECIPIENT FEEL 
DEPENDENT AND UNDER CONTINUOUS SCRUTINY BY AN UNFRIENDLY 
BUREAUCRACY.

ALL SUCH PAYMENTS CAN BE MADE AND PROCESSED THROUGH THE 
EXISTING STATE BANKING MACHINERY, ULTIMATELY USING "CASHLESS" 
METHODS OF PAYMENT.

 THE KEY TO BETTER SERVICES IS THE CONCEPT OF THE "ONE-STOP SHOP". 
THERE IS NO REASON WHY A PERSON WHO IS DEPENDENT ON SOCIAL 
WELFARE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ALL HIS OR HER ENTITLEMENTS, 
AND BE REGISTERED FOR ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT POSSIBILITIES, IN THE 
SAME LOCATION.


                  EDUCATION


THE GREEN PAPER WILL BE WITHDRAWN, AND EXTENSIVELY REDRAFTED TO 
REFLECT REAL PRIORITIES.

LABOUR RECOGNISES THAT THE RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR A PROPER 
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EDUCATION SERVICES WILL BE VERY CONSIDERABLE. 
BUT THE PRIORITIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

 REDUCTION OF CLASS SIZES IN THE PRIMARY SECTOR. ONE THOUSAND 
ADDITIONAL PRIMARY TEACHERS IS NEEDED BY 1996 TO REDUCE THE 
PUPIL/TEACHER RATIO FROM 25.1:1 DOWN TO 22.5:1.

 A FURTHER 1,000 TEACHERS IS REQUIRED IN THE SAME TIME SCALE TO 
PROVIDE REMEDIAL TEACHING FOR ALL WHO REQUIRE IT.

ACCESS TO THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY VITAL 
(AND INCREASINGLY UNEQUAL). LABOUR PROPOSES TO WORK TOWARDS A 
POSITION WHERE THE INCOME LIMIT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION GRANTS IS 
BASED ON NET INCOME, RATHER THAN GROSS INCOME AS AT PRESENT.

 LABOUR BELIEVES THAT URGENT CONSIDERATION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE 
INTRODUCTION BY THE END OF THE DECADE OF A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM 
OF PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION, WITH A PROPERLY DESIGNED CURRICULUM 
AND TRAINED TEACHERS.

SECOND-CHANCE EDUCATION MUST BE ADEQUATELY RESOURCED AND 
STRUCTURED TO BE AVAILABLE WITHIN EVERY COMMUNITY.

THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICE MUST BE EXPANDED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY 
CHILD WITH BEHAVIOURAL AND LEARNING DIFFICULTIES HAS ACCESS TO 
HELP AT THE EARLIEST STAGE. THERE IS A ROLE HERE FOR SCHOOL WELFARE 
OFFICERS, AS INDEED THERE IS IN THE AREA OF MORE EFFECTIVE 
DISCIPLINE.

RESOURCES MUST BE MORE EFFECTIVELY TARGETED AT AREAS OF GREATEST 
DISADVANTAGE. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM MUST BE SEEN IN THIS CONTEXT 
AS A WEAPON IN THE BATTLE AGAINST INSTITUTIONALISED INEQUALITY.

RATHER THAN THE PRESENT OVER-EMPHASIS ON TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN 
THE GREEN PAPER, THE EMPHASIS MUST BE ON DEVELOPING THE WHOLE 
PERSON - WE NEED A NEW EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPING CRITICAL AND 
CREATIVE FACULTIES.

LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT MUST BE A GREATER PRIORITY, FROM AN EARLIER 
AGE.

WE NEED A NEW AND CREATIVE EMPHASIS ON OUR OWN LANGUAGE, 
CULTURE, AND HERITAGE. OUR IDENTITY MUST BE PROUD, CONFIDENT, AND 
OUTWARD-LOOKING, AND OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS A MAJOR ROLE TO 
PLAY IN THAT.

CONTROL OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM MUST INCLUDE A MEANINGFUL ROLE 
FOR PARENTS.

NOT ENOUGH ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE STRESS INVOLVED IN 
TEACHING. JOB SATISFACTION MUST BE AN ISSUE, TO BE ADDRESSED BY 
REMOVING RIGIDITIES FROM THE SYSTEM AND ALLOWING TEACHERS TO 
MORE FULLY EXPRESS THE WIDER RANGE OF THEIR TALENTS.

WE WILL PROTECT THE INDEPENDENCE AND TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC 
DECISION-MAKING STRUCTURES OF THE UNIVERSITIES; PRESERVE THE 
DIVERSITY OF THE ACTIVITIES OF UNIVERSITIES; AND REJECT MEASURES TO 
CENTRALISE POWER.

              PUTTING TRUST INTO
                   POLITICS


WE INTEND TO EMBARK ON THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND REFORMING 
SERIES OF CHANGES IN STRUCTURES AND LEGISLATION EVER SEEN IN THIS 
COUNTRY. THE AIM OF THIS PROGRAMME OF REFORM IS TWO-FOLD:

FIRST, THE SECURING OF A FRAMEWORK FOR GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS 
THAT WILL NEVER BETRAY THE PEOPLE; AND SECOND, THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
OUR COMMITMENT TO THE SPIRIT OF PARTNERSHIP THAT WE BELIEVE 
IRELAND WANTS.

B.   WOMEN'S RIGHTS

   THE CONTINUING PROGRAMME WE INTEND TO PURSUE WILL START WITH 
ENACTMENT OF THE EQUAL STATUS BILL WHICH WE PUBLISHED LAST YEAR. 
OUR EQUAL STATUS BILL WAS AND REMAINS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE 
PIECE OF EQUALITY LEGISLATION EVER PRODUCED IN THIS COUNTRY. THE 
GROUNDS ON WHICH THE BILL PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION ACROSS A WIDE 
RANGE OF GROUNDS, INCLUDING SEX, MARITAL OR PARENTAL STATUS, 
SEXUAL ORIENTATION, RELIGION, AGE, HANDICAP, RACE, COLOUR, 
NATIONALITY, OR NATIONAL OR ETHNIC ORIGINS, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP 
OF THE TRAVELLING COMMUNITY.

SECONDLY, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE BILL IS TO MAKE DISCRIMINATION 
UNLAWFUL NOT ONLY IN THE WORK PLACE, BUT ALSO IN EDUCATION, IN THE 
PROVISION OF GOODS, FACILITIES, AND SERVICES (INCLUDING 
RECREATIONAL FACILITIES, AND SERVICES, ENTERTAINMENT, 
ACCOMMODATION, TRANSPORT, AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES), AND IN THE 
DISPOSAL OF PREMISES.

APART ALTOGETHER FROM THE BILL, WE WILL BE PURSUING, OVER THE 
SHORT AND LONGER TERM, A VERY AMBITIOUS EQUALITY PROGRAMME. IT 
WILL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC MEASURES:

 FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CHILD CARE ACT 1991; MAJOR 
EXPANSION OF CHILD CARE FACILITIES.

TOTAL REVIEW OF GENDER EQUALITY IN EDUCATION AND PROMOTION OF 
FULL CURRICULUM CHOICE FOR ALL STUDENTS. IN PARTICULAR ALL STUDENTS 
SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO EDUCATION FOR HOME MANAGEMENT AND TO 
POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDIES INCLUDING HUMAN AND CIVIC RIGHTS AND TO 
COMPREHENSIVE SEX EDUCATION.

 CAREER GUIDANCE PROGRAMMES TO BE ENHANCED TO INCLUDE A 
POSITIVE PROGRAMME TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO ENTER LABOUR MARKETS 
DOMINATED BY MEN AND TO DISPEL TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT 
PREJUDICES.

 PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON ADULT EDUCATION TO ENCOURAGE RE-ENTRY OF 
WOMEN INTO THE WORKPLACE.

PROMOTION OF WOMEN'S STUDIES IN THIRD LEVEL EDUCATION.

PROMOTION OF WOMEN IN PUBLIC LIFE BY STATE FUNDING OF A 
WOMEN'S OFFICER IN ALL POLITICAL PARTIES.

A MAJOR PROGRAMME OF FAMILY LAW REFORM, CULMINATING IN A 
REFERENDUM ON DIVORCE, MODERNISATION OF THE LAW OF NULLITY; 
PLACING A MONETARY VALUE ON WOMEN'S WORK IN THE HOME FOR THE 
PURPOSES OF PROPERTY DISTRIBUTION; EXTENSION OF BARRING ORDER 
LEGISLATION; LEGISLATION TO GIVE EACH SPOUSE AN EQUAL SHARE IN 
FAMILY ASSETS; INCREASE IN THE AGE OF MARRIAGE TO 18; ENHANCEMENT 
OF THE RIGHTS OF PARTIES IN NON-MARITAL RELATIONSHIPS.

LEVEL OF APPOINTMENTS, WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF REACHING A POSITION 
OF EQUALITY.

INTRODUCTION OF A "GENDER-PROOFING" POLICY FOR ALL LEGISLATION AND 
OTHER MAJOR GOVERNMENT DECISIONS TO ASSESS IMPACT ON WOMEN'S 
RIGHTS AND INTERESTS. IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THIS MAY BE CARRIED 
OUT IN PARTICULAR BY THE JOINT OIREACHTAS COMMITTEE ON WOMEN'S 
RIGHTS.

REVIEW OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF AREAS IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE WHERE 
WOMEN ARE EXCLUDED FROM EMPLOYMENT, E.G. CERTAIN

ASPECTS OF DEFENCE AND JUSTICE, TO ENSURE FULL EQUALITY OF 
OPPORTUNITY.

A SPORTS POLICY TO BE SPECIFICALLY GEARED TO INCREASING THE FULLEST

E. THE ARTS

INADEQUATE, AD HOC AND PIECEMEAL INADEQUATE CO-ORDINATION 
EXISTS BETWEEN CAPITAL EXPENDITURE (E.G. NATIONAL LOTTERY) AND 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CURRENT FUNDING OF ARTS PROJECTS. THE ARTS 
COUNCIL OUGHT TO OPERATE ON A CO-ORDINATED 3-YEARLY PLAN FOR 
FUNDING OF THE ARTS.

CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR TIMING OF FUNDING ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE 
INAPPROPRIATE FOR ARTS EVENTS WHICH NEED TO BE ORGANISED LONG 
AHEAD OF TIME.

FUNDING FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL SHOULD BE INCREASED TO THE LEVEL 
ENVISAGED BY THE PESP.

FUNDING OF THE ARTS BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES OUGHT TO BE ON A PLANNED 
BASIS RATHER THAN FACILITATING A SCATTERGUN APPROACH. AS WITH 
PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT, LOCAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE REQUIRED 
TO PRODUCE A COUNTY CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN, TO GUIDE PLANNED 
PRIORITIES FOR ARTS FUNDING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

THE REGIONAL AUTHORITIES ENVISAGED IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
REFORM PLAN WOULD CO-ORDINATE DECISIONS ON MAJOR ITEMS OF 
EXPENDITURE (E.G., THEATRES).

PROFESSIONAL ARTS STAFF ORGANISED IN AN ARTS DEPARTMENT. IN
