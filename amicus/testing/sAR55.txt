Despite efforts by GMAC, ELC and others to promote diversity, the number of underrepresented minority n2 students in MBA and other graduate programs remains deplorably low and does not remotely reflect the composition of American society as a whole. The underrepresentation of minority students in business school and other graduate schools means an equally troubling underrepresentation of minorities in leadership positions in the American workplace, and a cadre of graduates who are less capable of functioning effectively in an increasingly diverse - and global - economy. If graduate schools cannot consider race or ethnicity as one factor among many in the admissions process, the goal of achieving reasonable diversity in all levels of the American workforce will be substantially undermined. 

n2 For the purposes of this brief, the term "underrepresented minorities" refers to African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. 

GMAC's and ELC's arguments in support of the respondents are already well stated in the Brief for Amici Curiae Leading American Businesses in Support of Respondents. Therefore, to avoid duplicative briefing, GMAC and ELC adopt those arguments by reference, and urge the Court to uphold the University of Michigan Law School's admission policy. The policy is narrowly tailored to serve the compelling state interest of promoting diversity in education. 

CONCLUSION 

The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.
