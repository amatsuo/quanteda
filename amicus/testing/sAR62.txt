A. The Court Should Reaffirm Justice Powell's Opinion In Bakke That Diversity, Including Racial Diversity, Serves Compelling Interests In Excellence, Leadership, And Experimentation In Higher Education 

Justice Powell eloquently explained in Bakke why "the attainment of a diverse student body," including a racially diverse student body, "is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education." Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-12 (emphasis added). 

First, "academic freedom, though not a specifically enumerated constitutional right, long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment" and embraces "'the four essential freedoms' of a university--to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who may be admitted to study." Id. at 312 (quoting Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring)). As Justice Powell observed, a "robust exchange of ideas" is of "transcendent value to us all," and an institution seeking the right to select "those students who will contribute the most" to such an exchange must be viewed as "seeking to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission." Id. at 313. 

Second, "the atmosphere of 'speculation, experimentation and creation'--so essential to the quality of higher education--is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body." Id. at 312. Indeed, "few students and no one who has practiced law would choose to study in an academic vacuum removed from the interplay of ideas and  [*5]  the exchange of views with which the law is concerned." Id. at 314. 

Third, graduates should be equipped "to render with understanding their vital service to humanity." Id. Further, "it is not too much to say that the 'nation's future depends upon leaders trained through exposure' to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples." Id. at 313 (quoting Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967)). 

Since Bakke, the Court has never wavered in its recognition of the unique role higher education serves in our society. In Metro Broadcasting, Justice Brennan, speaking for the Court, reiterated that "'a diverse student body' contributing to a 'robust exchange of ideas' is a 'constitutionally permissible goal' on which a raceconscious university admissions program may be predicated." Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 568 (1990) (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-12), overruled on other grounds, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). Similarly, in Wygant, Justice O'Connor stated in concurrence, "although its precise contours are uncertain, a state interest in the promotion of racial diversity has been found sufficiently 'compelling,' at least in the context of higher education, to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that interest." Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 276 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring). 

For the 25 years since Bakke, diversity within a student body, including racial diversity, has been widely acknowledged as a compelling goal for higher education. The regulations implementing Title VI, for example, follow Bakke and expressly provide that when an institution's  [*6]  programs and services are "not in fact equally available to some racial or nationality groups," the institution "may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such groups." 34 C.F.R. § 100.5(i). "For example, where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other steps to provide such group with more adequate service." Id. Title VI funding has opened the door to higher education for many qualified students, and Amici have relied on its regulatory framework and funding to ensure their campuses are open to qualified students of diverse races and backgrounds. 

In the cases now before the Court, there is no credible dispute as to the truths spoken by Justice Powell in Bakke--that a racially diverse student body serves and enriches the higher education of all students and is essential to the training of leaders for our pluralistic world. Indeed, the evidence that meaningful interaction among students of different racial backgrounds improves the quality of education for all students is extensive and unchallenged. Grutter v. Bollinger, 288 F.3d 732, 759-769 (6th Cir. 2002) (Clay, J., concurring). As former Princeton University President, William G. Bowen, has observed:
  
[A] great deal of learning occurs informally. It occurs through interactions among students of both sexes; of different races, religions, and backgrounds; who come from cities and rural areas, from various states and countries; who have a variety of interests, talents and perspectives; and who are able directly, or indirectly, to learn from their differences and to stimulate one another to  [*7]  reexamine their most deeply and widely held assumptions about themselves and their world. As a wise graduate of ours observed in commenting on this aspect of the educational process, 'People do not learn very much when surrounded only by the likes of themselves.'
  
William G. Bowen, "Admissions and the Relevance of Race," Princeton Alumni Weekly 7, 9 (September 26, 1977). 

The amicus briefs filed in support of petitioners thus acknowledge the importance of ensuring that educational institutions "are open and accessible to a broad and diverse array of individuals, including individuals of all races and ethnicities" and of "measures that ensure diversity, accessibility and opportunity." United States Brf. in Grutter, at 9-10. Florida confirms that "because of its ethnically and racially diverse population, Florida has an interest in promoting diversity in higher education." Florida Brf., at 1. 

If, as acknowledged by petitioners and their amici, the "central purpose" of the Equal Protection Clause is to "create a Nation of equal citizens . . . where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement" [United States Brf. in Grutter, at 13 (citing Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277, and Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432 (1986)], it is unimaginable that this clause precludes colleges and universities from fostering the same goal when composing a learning environment for all students. Equal opportunity for citizens of all races does not require indifference to race; instead, it requires appreciation and mutual respect that can only be achieved through productive and robust interaction. See William G. Bowen & Derek Bok, The Shape of the River, at 7 (1998) ("Enriching the education of all . . . students by including race as another element in  [*8]  assembling a diverse student body of varying talents, backgrounds, and perspectives" is a goal shared by institutions of higher learning, business, and government alike, in part because of our Nation's increasingly heterogeneous society.) 

Diversity on campus, moreover, assures Amici's responsiveness to their communities. Without exception, Amici have learned that their students and supporters expect the enriched and robust academic exchange that can be achieved only on a campus of diverse students. See William G. Bowen & Neil L. Rudenstine, Race-Sensitive Admissions: Back to Basics, at 2-3 (February 3, 2003) available at http://www.mellon.org/publications/Admissions/load.htm (explaining that survey responses from more than 90,000 alumni of selective institutions show "nearly 80 percent of those enrolled in 1976 and 1989 felt their alma mater placed the right amount of emphasis--or not enough--on diversity in the admissions process"). 

Amici do not include race as part of their quest for diversity because they believe each member of a racial minority has the same point of view. To the contrary, Amici recognize race as one of the innumerable factors that ineluctably affect and mold a student's perspective and individuality. In honoring Justice Thurgood Marshall, Justice O'Connor observed that he brought to the Court "a special perspective" because he was intimately familiar with the plight of those who regularly encountered racial discrimination. Sandra Day O'Connor, Thurgood Marshall: The Influence of a Raconteur, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 1217, 1217 (1992). No one would suggest Justice Marshall brought a pre-ordained "African American" perspective to the Court--there is no such thing. Rather, he brought his own  [*9]  perspective that was necessarily shaped in some measure by his race. Thus, racial diversity is not meant to bring, and does not bring, a "racial" perspective to higher education. It does ensure, however, the wide array of students needed to fulfill higher education's promise of "speculation, experimentation and creation." Bakke, 438 U.S. at 312. 
  
B. The Court Should Reaffirm Justice Powell's Opinion In Bakke That Race May Be Considered, As One Of Many Factors, In A Narrowly Tailored Effort To Achieve Meaningful Diversity In Higher Education 

In considering whether a race-sensitive measure is "narrowly tailored" to achieve a compelling interest, the courts must determine (1) whether that interest can be achieved through race-neutral alternatives and (2) the harm imposed by the measure. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 510 (1989). Petitioners and their amici argue even limited consideration of race when reviewing candidates for admission is never appropriate because race-neutral means to achieve meaningful diversity are always available. To that end, petitioners and their amici point to guaranteed admissions programs used by some large public universities and to supposedly race-neutral criteria they claim could be used to enroll a diverse student body. 

Whether or not these race-neutral strategies work for large public university systems, they could not work for selective private colleges and universities. The limited size of private colleges and universities makes any guaranteed admissions program unworkable, much less the programs adopted by California, Texas, and Florida, which guarantee  [*10]  admission to the top four, 10 and 20 percent of graduating seniors within their states, respectively. Those public university systems each enroll over 100,000 students at multiple campuses. Even if every graduating high school senior eligible under those state programs elected to enroll, these massive university systems could accommodate them. California Institute of Technology, however, enrolls only 942 undergraduate students at a single campus. Even the largest Amicus could not accommodate a fraction of the candidates who would be eligible for guaranteed admission based on class rank. 

Nor were Amici established to serve only local residents or other limited pools of candidates. The California, Texas and Florida public university systems serve their respective taxpayers and thus confine their guaranteed admissions to high schools within their state. But Amici recruit nationally and internationally. Thus, they cannot limit the pool of high schools that offer candidates for admission. 

Guaranteed admissions would also destroy one of the most important contributions Amici make to our system of higher education--their individuality and uniqueness of academic mission. The optimal mix of students differs from school to school. A small liberal arts college may seek a different assortment of students than a flagship state university. A college that focuses on the performing or fine arts may place a premium on applicants' musical or artistic interest and ability. A college that emphasizes agricultural studies may recruit candidates with farming or ranching backgrounds. A sectarian institution may consider demonstrated religious conviction as important  [*11]  as grades and test scores. Thus, not only does their size preclude the use of admission programs based on class rank, but Amici have no desire to guarantee admission to any subset of candidates identified by a simple litmus test. 

Moreover, to a large degree, the touted success of the "race-neutral" admissions programs offered by California, Texas and Florida university systems is illusory. Those programs fail to achieve the fundamental goal of diversity in education--to enrich the education of all students by exposing them to an array of experiences, perspectives, and social interactions, including some related to race. For example, the United States asserts that the California, Texas and Florida "percent" programs enhance diversity within their university "systems." United States Brf. in Grutter, at 17-21. But a state "system" of public universities (e.g., 33 campuses in two California systems, 27 campuses in three Texas systems, and 11 public universities in Florida) is not a proper benchmark for diversity. Students at one campus in a state "system" have no greater exposure to students at another campus in the same "system," than they have to students at any other distant campus. Only diversity on a campus matters. 

Yet, in California, Texas and Florida, diversity has decreased at their most selective, and prominent, campuses. See Catherine L. Horn and Stella M. Flores, Percent Plans in College Admissions: A Comparative Analysis of Three States' Experiences, The Civil Rights Project Harvard University, at 58 (February 2003) available at http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/affirmativeaction/tristate.pdf ("The percent plans seem to have the least impact on the most competitive campuses, which have persisting losses in spite of many levels of efforts to  [*12]  make up for affirmative action."); Brian Bucks, Affirmative Access Versus Affirmative Action: How Have Texas' Race-Blind Policies Affected College Outcomes? at 6 (February 5, 2003) available at http://www.utdallas.edu/research/greenctr/Papers/pdfpapers/paper33.pdf (showing that under Texas' program, the number of African American students attending the state's flagship schools has fallen roughly 45 percent and the number of Hispanic students has fallen roughly 30 percent); Patricia Marin and Edgar K. Lee, Appearance and Reality in The Sunshine State, The Civil Rights Project Harvard University, at 36 (February 2003) available at http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/affirmativeaction/florida.pdf ("Even a brief discussion of the policies and practices on the state's two most selective campuses reveals a strikingly different picture than that portrayed by state leaders. There is simply no evidence that the Talented 20 program had any significant impact in dealing with the termination of affirmative action in admissions on these campuses."). 

Further, the California, Texas, and Florida admissions programs are not, in fact, "race neutral." Those programs depend entirely upon continued segregation among the states' high schools. See John F. Kain & Daniel M. O'Brien, Hopwood and the Top 10 Percent Law: How They Have Affected the College Enrollment Decisions of Texas High School Graduates, at 30-31 (February 5, 2003) available at http://www.utdallas.edu/research/greenctr/Papers/pdfpapers/paper26.html ("Another disturbing feature of [Texas'] top 10 Percent Law is its dependence on school and residential segregation to achieve the goal of increasing the representation of disadvantaged minorities at the state's selective public universities."); Race-Sensitive Admissions: Back to Basics, at 13-15 ("Do we really want to endorse an  [*13]  admissions approach that depends on de facto segregation at the secondary-school level?"). 

Nor are admissions programs that focus solely on grades and class rank educationally sound. Such programs cut across a state's graduating high school class with the refinement of a meat ax: they exclude well qualified minority students who attended competitive secondary schools, while including lesser qualified minority students from lower performing schools. They may also reward students for taking "easy" classes or remaining at inferior high schools to maintain high grade point averages, while punishing students who accept the challenge of advanced classes or highly competitive schools. 

In contrast to rote, guaranteed admissions programs, selective colleges and universities evaluate individuals, rather than statistics. The "best" grades do not necessarily mean the "best" qualified for admission to a college or university. While high school academic success is an important factor, Amici look at considerably more--like the applicant's curriculum, writing skills, extra-curricular activities, artistic talents, athletic ability and leadership skills--to decide which students best "fit" their mission and philosophy. Race-Sensitive Admissions: Back to Basics, at 4-5, 8-9; The Shape of the River, at 24-25 ("One often hears that students with top scores and the highest grades should be admitted "on the merits," as if these measures were the sole legitimate basis for admission and that other considerations were somehow insubstantial or even morally suspect. This is patently false. Deciding which students have the most 'merit' depends on what one is trying to achieve."). 

 [*14]  Amici also cannot ignore the racially disparate impact of other factors commonly considered in admissions decisions. The College Board, which administers the SAT's, publishes data on its website demonstrating that, among college-bound seniors taking the tests in 2002, the differences between the mean scores for "White" students and for African-American students were 97 points for Verbal and 106 points for Math, out of a maximum of 800 points on each test. http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/cbsenior/yr2002/pdf/threeC.pdf. Two percent of the African American students taking the test last year scored above 650 in either Verbal or Math, while the comparable figures for White students were 12 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Id. Similar, if somewhat less dramatic, disparities in test scores also hamper Native American and Hispanic students. Id. High school grades, another seemingly race-neutral factor, also can disadvantage qualified minority applicants. According to the College Board, African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, apply to college with notably lower grade point averages than do non-minority students. See http://www.collegeboard.com/press/releases_main. 

Amici are acutely aware that such allegedly race-neutral factors tend to skew admissions against meaningful diversity, and thus are unanimous in considering race as one positive factor, among many factors, in admissions decisions. Through years of admitting minority students based on their overall qualifications, and not solely their grades and test scores, Amici have proven that these students prosper in, and make unique contributions to, higher education. 

 [*15]  Some have suggested Amici could use proxies for race, like low income or social disadvantage, to enhance minority enrollment on their campuses. But Amici already consider, and give appropriate weight to, such factors. Moreover, income is simply a poor proxy for race. In a study of 1992 high school graduates, the Brookings Institution found that, among high school graduates with family incomes below $ 20,000 and test scores in the top 10 percent, only one in six was African American. Thomas J. Kane, "Racial and Ethnic Preferences in College Admissions," in The Black-White Test Score Gap, at 431, 450 (Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips eds., 1998). Thus, as Bowen and Bok observe, the "substitution of a class-based system would drastically reduce the quality of the eligible pool of Black and Hispanic applicants, seriously impeding the goal of preparing the ablest minority leaders for society and the professions." The Shape of the River, at 51. 

Because "race neutral" admissions plans cannot achieve the compelling need for diversity in higher education, the Court must consider whether Amici's limited consideration of race, as one of many factors, in selecting students for admission imposes "disproportionate harm on the interests, or unnecessarily trammel[s] the rights, of innocent individuals directly and adversely affected by [such] racial preference." Wygant, 476 U.S. at 287 (emphasis added) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Here, the relevant inquiry is not whether an applicant would have been admitted had he or she been a member of an under-represented minority, but whether he or she would have been admitted had race not been considered at all. Viewed in this light, Amici's admissions programs plainly withstand strict scrutiny since they have a negligible impact on  [*16]  other students' chances of admission. The Shape of the River, at 9 (finding limited consideration of race at a subset of selective colleges and universities reduced majority applicants' prospects for admittance from 26.2 to 25 percent); Race-Sensitive Admissions: Back to Basics, at 9-11. 

Finally, if a diverse student body is a compelling goal in higher education--as most agree--Amici believe it far better to pursue diversity directly and honestly, rather than by proxy. "Surely the best way to achieve racial diversity is to acknowledge candidly that minority status is one among many factors that can be considered in an admissions process designed to judge individuals on a case-by-case basis." Race-Sensitive Admissions: Back to Basics, at 16. 
  
C. The Court Should Preserve Academic Freedom And The Spirit Of Experimentation Vital To Higher Education By Preserving The Ability Of Colleges And Universities To Consider Race As One Of Many Factors When Selecting Students For Admission 

Our colleges and universities, like our Nation as a whole, continue to struggle with the legacy of racism and bigotry. If higher education is to contribute to the understanding and eradication of that legacy, it must explore it and challenge it--not merely as a historical artifact, but as a dynamic characteristic of contemporary society. Like the search for excellence in education itself, which admits no single path or model, the pursuit of diversity and understanding in higher education should be left to colleges and universities that "perform their role as laboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where  [*17]  the best solution is far from clear." United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 581 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring). 

Amici, as private, not public, institutions of higher education, have a special role in this quest. As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly two hundred years ago in The Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 17 U.S. 518, 634 (1819), private colleges and universities benefit our Nation by charting their academic missions free of political pressures and exigencies. "The eleemosynary institutions do not fill the place which would otherwise be occupied by government, but that which would otherwise remain vacant. . . . It is probable that no man ever was, and that no man ever will be, the founder of a college, . . . believing that it is immediately to be deemed a public institution, whose funds are to be governed and applied, not by the will of the donor, but by the will of the legislature." Id. at 647. 

Our private colleges and universities have long made beneficial use of their academic freedom to foster and achieve meaningful diversity. In fact, many Amici were founded in response to the bigotries of the day and to embark on the quest for equality to which they remain committed today. For example:
  
. Dickinson College was founded in 1783 by Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and one of the country's earliest proponents of student diversity. A staunch abolitionist who helped establish the first African-American church in Philadelphia, Dr. Rush encouraged students to study modern languages and foreign cultures. 
  
 [*18]  . Gettysburg College was founded in 1832 by abolitionist Samuel S. Schmucker under the name Pennsylvania College. Another well-known abolitionist, Thaddeus Stevens, author of the Fourteenth Amendment, provided the College's original six acres. 
  
. Brandeis University was founded in 1948 by the American Jewish Community in part to respond to quotas limiting the access of Jews to higher education.
Thus, Amici are progenitors of and heirs to our Nation's commitment to openness and inclusion. Amici continue to invest themselves in this undertaking, taking the time and committing the resources to consider many factors, including race, in deciding who they will admit to their institutions. As a result, they have fostered innovation, leadership, and academic excellence, while infusing our national commitment to higher education with the vibrancy of their own diversity. 

CONCLUSION 

Amici do not suggest every college or university must consider race in the same way, or even at all, when selecting students for admission. They do suggest, however, that selective private colleges and universities cannot achieve meaningful diversity on their campuses without continuing to have that academic tool at their disposal. Whatever the Court may believe might work in large public university systems, Amici's circumstances are significantly different. Amici respectfully ask the Court to allow them  [*19]  to continue to steer the course of the river shaped by Bakke for the good of their students, their respective institutions, and our Nation.
