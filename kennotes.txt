tokenize(corpus)  
Would tokenize the corpus according to settings, create a dfm, and record a list with the following named elements:
tokenization[[c("dfm", "ntypes", "ntokens", "nsents", "nparagraphs", "syllables")]]
dfm is the standard dfm
syllables is the ntypes-length vector of syllable counts for each type
this can be accessed for quick dfm creation, print, summary, etc.
would be set to null if a setting any setting is changed
