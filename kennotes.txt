corpus definition:
------------------

needs the following document-level meta-data:
(defaults are NULL, except where noted)
_language
_encoding (default is system encoding)
_source
_url
_author
_title
_datecreated
_dateadded
where:
metadoc(corpus, "fieldname")<- will assign these fields

settings(corpus, "setting")<- will assign corpus level settings
settings list: (defaults are NULL)
stopwords
collocations
dictionary
stemming (settings: none, English, etc (from SnowBall))
delimiters_sentence.  ".!?"
delimiters_word - default " ", but could be c(" ", ";", "â€¢")
delimiters_paragraph - default \n\n, but could be \n
clean settings
settings(corpus) - prints the current settings

tokenize(corpus)  
Would tokenize the corpus according to settings, create a dfm, and record a list with the following named elements:
tokenization[[c("dfm", "ntypes", "ntokens", "nsents", "nparagraphs", "syllables")]]
dfm is the standard dfm
syllables is the ntypes-length vector of syllable counts for each type
this can be accessed for quick dfm creation, print, summary, etc.
would be set to null if a setting any setting is changed
