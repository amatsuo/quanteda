I. The Educational Benefits Of Achieving A Diverse Population Of Students In The Fields Of Science And Engineering Are Compelling 

MIT and Stanford share the views of other colleges and universities, public and private, about the need for diversity in teaching the humanities and liberal arts and in professional schools. See Br. of Harvard Univ., et al., Likewise, DuPont and IBM, as major international corporations, concur with other such businesses concerning the general need for diversity in education in order to prepare future business and technical leaders to deal in a shrinking and diverse world. See Br. of 38 Leading American Businesses. 

But Amici chose to file this brief, instead of joining another, more general one, in order to make a complementary but additional point that is sometimes overlooked. Amici hope to dispel the view that diversity in science and engineering education is any less important than in the humanities and liberal arts. Amici assert that diversity (broadly defined and including racial and ethnic diversity) is in fact absolutely essential to the advancement of science and engineering - in part for the same reasons that it is important for higher education generally, but also for a host of other reasons peculiarly related to these fields, and to their critical world role. And minorities are even more under-represented in science and engineering fields than in others. n8

A. Many Justifications Commonly Offered For A Broadly Diverse Student Body Are No Less Applicable To Study In The Areas Of Science And Engineering 

Much of what students learn in college comes from experiences studying, living, and working with other  [*10]  students, faculty, and administrators in an academic community that extends beyond the classroom. n9 This is true in all disciplines, including science and engineering. For that reason, in the spirit of Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), many academic institutions, including Stanford and MIT, regard a diverse student body - broadly defined to include consideration of race, national origin, and gender as well as other demographic characteristics such as geographic background and socioeconomic disadvantage - to be an important aspect of the education they provide their students, and believe that such diversity greatly enhances the experience of all students. 

n9 MIT's students pay substantial tuition for the full academic experience on campus, even though MIT has recently decided to offer the substantive content of most of its courses free of charge over the internet in its OpenCourseWare program, available at http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html. See also http://ocw.mit.edu/global/faq.html#FAQ17; WILLIAM G. BOWEN & DEREK BOK, THE SHAPE OF THE RIVER: LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF CONSIDERING RACE IN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS 24 (2d ed. 2000). 

A diverse academic community stimulates critical, reflective, and complex thinking, enhancing students' problem-solving abilities. n10 Moreover, racial and ethnic diversity in higher education significantly contributes to students' ability to live and work together, and to communicate across racial boundaries - skills of great importance in our increasingly heterogeneous world. n11 The  [*11]  ability to work effectively and live harmoniously with diverse individuals is significantly more likely to be acquired in multi-cultural and multi-racial academic settings. n12 As one MIT graduate, Kofi A. Annan (SM 1972 (management)), put it:
I would hope that in the education we give to the young--because we are preparing the leaders of the twenty-first century, they are our future--they will come to understand that the world today is an interdependent world, a global village. No one . . . can afford to think in purely local terms. If you do, you are going to be a loser down the line. n13

B. In A Number Of Critical Respects, The Importance Of Diversity Is Heightened In The Fields Of Science And Engineering 

 [*12]  1. Collaboration with diverse individuals is a critical part of science and engineering 

The advancement of science has become an increasingly collaborative enterprise, n14 and science and engineering have increasingly become global enterprises that cannot be limited by boundaries, backgrounds, races or cultures. "There is no national science just as there is no national multiplication table." n15 "The common laws of nature cross political boundaries, and the international movement of people and knowledge made science global long before 'globalization' became a label for the increasing interconnections among the world's economies." n16 

n14 See THE EVOLVING MIT CAMPUS: STUDENT LIFE AND LEARNING, available at http://web.mit.edu/evolving/student. html and THE EVOLVING MIT CAMPUS: SHAPING THE FUTURE, available at http://web.mit.edu/evolving/shaping.html (discussing MIT's "reinvented academic village," with buildings designed solely to "inspire teamwork, communication, and collaboration at all levels of campus life"); STANFORD UNIVERSITY, SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, 2000-2001 ANNUAL REPORT, available at http://soe.stanford.edu/AR00-01/letter_dean.html ("Collaboration helps us leverage our resources and fosters the atmosphere of bold thinking for which the school is world renowned.").

As the United States becomes both more racially and ethnically diverse, and increasingly connected with the other nations and peoples of the world, the need for scientists and engineers to work with individuals of other races and ethnicities becomes an inescapable reality. n17 Consequently,  [*13]  the National Science Foundation's 1997-to-2003 strategic plan requires the agency "to strive for a diverse, globally oriented workforce of scientists and engineers." n18 Collaboration, both nationally and internationally, with people of other races, cultures and ethnic backgrounds, has increased significantly n19 and is of vital importance. n20 

n17 See MIT REPORT OF THE AD HOC FACULTY COMMITTEE, supra note 16, at i-ii, 1-6; 1 SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING INDICATORS, supra note 8, at 3-27 to 3-31, 5-24 to 5-26, 5-37 to 5-38, 5-43 to 5-49. See also SHAPE OF THE RIVER, supra note 9, at 223. 

n18 See NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, WOMEN, MINORITIES AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING: 2000 1 (2000). 

n19 International scientific collaboration has increased significantly in the last two decades, as measured by numbers of articles co-authored across national borders, due to: (1) advances in information technology; (2) economic growth; (3) the growing scale, cost, and complexity of scientific research; (4) new political ties following the end of the cold war; and (5) the advanced education of students outside their native countries. See 1 SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING INDICATORS, supra note 8, at 5-43 to 5-44.

U.S. industry also increasingly relies on R&D performed abroad."); id. at 2-36 ("The United States needs to devise effective forms of collaboration and information exchange to benefit from, and link to, the expanding scientific capabilities of other countries and regions."). 

2. Diversity leads to increased creativity, productivity, and success in the science and engineering fields 

Because science and engineering are inherently creative professions, ideas and innovations in these fields are affected by the life experiences of the people involved in their creation. n21 Diverse work teams create better and more innovative products and ideas than homogeneous teams. n22  [*14]  Indeed, multifaceted diversity in a company, including racial and ethnic, as well as gender n23 and other kinds of diversity, "consistently correlates to superior corporate performance." n24 As William Wulf, President of the National Academy of Engineering, noted in 1998, there is "a real economic cost" that flows from an absence of racial and cultural diversity in the field of engineering:
  
The range of design options considered in a team lacking diversity will be smaller. . . . The constraints on the design will not be properly interpreted. . . . The product that serves a broader international customer base, or a segment of this nation's melting pot, or our handicapped, may not be found. . . . The most elegant solution may never be pursued. . . . [This cost] is measured in design options not considered, in needs unsatisfied and hence unfulfilled. It is measured in 'might have beens,' and those kinds of costs are very hard to measure. That doesn't change the fact that they are very real and very important. n25

n23 It is worth noting in passing that the issue of gender diversity is also important in the fields of science and engineering, an issue that was the subject of a conference held at MIT on January 23, 2001. See, e.g., http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/nr/2001/gender.html; http://www.stanford.edu/dept/legal/Worddocs/mitconf.pdf.

3. Diversity within science and engineering is vital to this country's economic growth 

 [*15]  "The national and world economies, as well as our national security, increasingly are driven by science, engineering and technology." n26 These fields increase productivity and are the sources of discoveries and inventions that enhance everyone's well-being. For decades, the United States has enjoyed a leadership role in the development and implementation of cutting-edge research and technology. As a result, this country has benefited many times over by its investment in science and engineering research in industry, universities, and government laboratories. It is no exaggeration to say that "national security, the health of our nation, and the strength of our economy depend heavily on the advancement of science and technology." n27 

n26 MIT REPORT OF THE AD HOC FACULTY COMMITTEE, supra note 16, at 1-6. The National Science Foundation ("NSF") has found that "scientists and engineers contribute enormously to technological innovation and economic growth," far exceeding in economic impact the less than 5% of the U.S. civilian workforce that they represent. Scientists and engineers, even those with only bachelor's degrees, spend a significant portion of their time doing research and development. 1 SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING INDICATORS, supra note 8, at 3-4, 3-10 to 3-11. Technology "is increasingly recognized as a key determinant of economic growth by most nations. . . ." Id. at 5-44. Consequently, the demand for scientists and engineers is projected to significantly exceed that of other occupations this decade. Id. at 3-27. The NSF thus has concluded that "science is a global enterprise [and has been so] long before 'globalization' [and that the] nation's international economic competitiveness . . . depends on the U.S. labor force's innovation and productivity." Id. at 3-27 to 3-28. 

n27 MIT REPORT OF THE AD HOC FACULTY COMMITTEE, supra note 16, at 15. 

Only a well-educated workforce comprised of people who have learned to work productively and creatively with individuals from a multitude of races and backgrounds can maintain America's leadership and competitiveness in the increasingly diverse and interconnected world economy. The increasing racial and ethnic diversity of our population  [*16]  magnifies the importance of educating more minority scientists and engineers. 

Demographic studies make this fact undeniable. Over the next 30 years, the numbers of minorities in this country will grow from their current number (approximately one-fourth of the population) to constitute over one-third of the U.S. population, while the white population will decrease. n28 African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans already constitute 30% of the college age population today, and by 2025, the National Science Foundation estimates that they will comprise 38% of the college age population. n29 It is anticipated that the minority population will actually surpass the non-minority population shortly after 2050. n30

Indeed, in California--from which Stanford admits 40% of its students--under-represented minorities constituted more than 55% of the public school population in 2001-2002. See CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, EDUCATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS UNIT, available at http://data1.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/Cbeds1.asp?Enroll=on&PctBlack=on&PctAm=on&PctAsian=on&PctFil=onPctHisp=on&PctPac=on&PctWhite=on&PctMult=on&Grads=on&cChoice+StatProfl&cYear=2001-02&cLevel=State&submit1=Submit. 

While their representation in the population is substantial and increasing, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans are currently significantly under-represented in the study and practice of science and engineering. n31 Of the approximately 18% of all bachelor's degrees that have  [*17]  historically been earned in the natural and physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering fields, n32 these minority groups, who make up 30% of the college population, together account for only 13%. n33 Unsurprisingly, the low representation of these groups in science and engineering academic programs has led to disproportionately low numbers of minorities in science and engineering occupations. n34 As minority representation in the population steadily increases, their underrepresentation in science and engineering fields becomes ever more consequential to the ability of American businesses to meet the demands of the marketplace. n35

 [*18]  To the extent that the need for technology leadership cannot be met by American business, such leadership will shift to countries with higher "research capacity, scientific output, and innovative capacity." n36 Enrollment of students in science and engineering programs in other countries is high and growing relative to the United States. n37 The American pool of science and engineering students and researchers must be deepened by cultivating the scientific and technical talents of all its citizens, not just those groups that have traditionally worked in science, technology, and engineering fields. n38

4. American businesses operating in the areas of science and engineering depend on institutions of higher education to produce a diverse pool of scientists and engineers 

 [*19]  In seeking to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of their science and engineering programs, selective private universities, such as MIT and Stanford, as well as public ones, define their educational missions broadly to include service of the nation to meet the great challenges of the times. Thus, they are motivated in part by the needs of the important professions and occupations in which their students will find employment. n39 Employers of scientists and engineers seek diverse candidates, and they rely on colleges and universities to provide them with employees who possess the skills necessary to succeed in today's global and collaborative scientific and technological environment. 

n39 See, e.g., Derek Bok, The Uncertain Future of Race-Sensitive Admissions (forthcoming article) (manuscript at 3-13), available at http://www.nacua.org/documents/Unceratin_Future_of_Race_Sensitive_Admissions_Revised.pdf. 

The business amici illustrate this need. DuPont and IBM believe that having a racially and ethnically diverse workforce is critical to their strength and success. "From Dupont's perspective, to continue to be globally competitive our company must have an employee base that is as diverse as the customers who buy our products, the shareholders who buy our stock, the vendors who supply us with goods and services, and the communities in which we operate." n40 Likewise, diversifying its workforce is part of IBM's "competitive strategy," which "has become more important than ever in the face of today's changing demographics and the rapid globalization of business." n41 Not only are diverse  [*20]  work teams more innovative and creative, but they actually are proven to "yield better business solutions--and better bottom-line results." n42 These companies, and countless others like them, therefore support the race-conscious admissions processes of selective private and public schools like MIT and Stanford.

II. Race-Conscious Recruiting And Selection Processes Are Essential To Achieve Racial Diversity At Selective Colleges And Universities, Especially In The Fields Of Science And Engineering 

A. Selective Universities, Such As Stanford And MIT, Consider Race As One Of Many Factors In Their Admissions Processes 

For many reasons, MIT, Stanford, and most other competitive universities have long concluded that neither test scores, grades, nor any other single indicator offers a simple solution to the complex question of who should be admitted from a large pool of qualified applicants. While such indicators provide some measure of ability and/or performance within a particular frame of reference, standing alone they provide a poor basis for making admissions decisions. Overwhelming empirical evidence supported by over a century of scientific research unrelated to concerns over racial diversity indicates that a university's complex educational goals and institutional mission cannot be achieved solely by relying on objective criteria such as standardized test scores. n43 This research, including studies  [*21]  by the National Research Council, n44 has revealed that the use of standardized-test scores as the sole measure of merit is scientifically indefensible and that the claim that a higher score should guarantee one student admission over another is not justifiable on empirical grounds. n45 Thus, selective private colleges and universities, as well as many public ones, generally seek to advance their objectives by employing admissions processes that take into account a multitude of individual factors. 

n43 Indeed, such reliance would violate the educational and psychological testing professions' standards. See AMERICAN EDUCATION RESEARCH ASSOCIATION & AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION, NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATION, STANDARDS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS (1999). 

n44 The National Research Council's work in the area of testing began during the First World War, when the National Academy of Sciences prepared a comprehensive study of the results of the Army testing program. More recent studies include: ABILITY TESTING: USES, CONSEQUENCES, AND CONTROVERSIES (1982); ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE: DILEMMA FOR GOVERNMENT, SCIENCE, AND THE PUBLIC (1982); FAIRNESS IN EMPLOYMENT TESTING (1989); PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT FOR THE WORKPLACE (1991); LEE CRONBACH, A VALEDICTORY: REFLECTIONS ON 60 YEARS IN EDUCATIONAL TESTING (1995); EDUCATING ONE AND ALL (1997); HIGH STAKES: TESTING FOR TRACKING, PROMOTION, AND GRADUATION (1999); UNCOMMON MEASURES (1999); TESTING, TEACHING, AND LEARNING (1999); EMBEDDING QUESTIONS (1999); GRADING THE NATION'S REPORT CARD (1999); KNOWING WHAT STUDENTS KNOW (2001); SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN EDUCATION (2002); EVALUATING AND IMPROVING UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (2003). 

n45 See NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, NATIONAL ACADEMY PRESS, MYTHS AND TRADEOFFS: THE ROLE OF TESTS IN UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS 17-24, 30 (1999) ("MYTHS AND TRADEOFFS") (concluding, inter alia, that (i) "the claim that a higher [test] score should guarantee one student preference over another is not justifiable"; (ii) standardized tests should be used only as part of a comprehensive program of screening, selection, and admissions because they "were not designed to provide information about all of the factors that influence success in college," and were not "designed to make fine distinctions at any point on their scales"; (iii) tests "are most useful . . . for sorting an applicant pool into broad categories: those who are quite likely to succeed academically at a particular institution [and] those who are quite unlikely to do so . . ."; and (iv) "because of the gap between majority and minority students' test scores, a greater proportion of minorities are rejected despite their capacity to succeed"). 

 [*22]  While no two admissions processes are precisely identical, many institutions utilize a highly individualized and subjective process similar to those employed by MIT and Stanford. Such processes are very different from the percentage plans used by Texas, California, and Florida, which condition admission on a single criterion, and which, in any event, are utterly useless to national, selective universities. Omitting many specifics of procedure, sequence, and terminology in which they differ, MIT and Stanford have in common (with each other and many other institutions) the following elements: 

Both MIT and Stanford confine in-depth consideration to candidates likely to have strong prospects for academic success at these institutions by first setting a high threshold level of intellectual ability and achievement. Both schools discern this required minimum level of qualification from a number of indicators, which include grades and test scores and do not include race. These are the students who, based on these indicators, demonstrate a high level of qualification and the ability to succeed academically. 

Of the large pool of capable candidates, MIT and Stanford have the capacity to admit only a small fraction. n46 Defining qualification of this capable pool in much broader terms than just grades and test scores, and rejecting many candidates who have very high scores but lack other important qualities, MIT and Stanford employ a subjective process to consider each candidate's full range of accomplishments, experiences, and potential. Most fundamentally, in addition to academic achievement and intellectual vitality, experienced admissions officers in both schools search for indicators of a candidate's talent, creativity, problem-solving orientation, dedication, and determination. These qualities and others are evaluated in the context of a candidate's experiences, including culture,  [*23]  advantages enjoyed, disadvantages overcome, potential realized, "distance traveled," and all other relevant information. 

n46 Stanford admitted approximately 13% and MIT approximately 16% of applicants for the 2002 freshman class. 

Race, national origin, and ethnicity, along with other considerations, are sometimes relevant in this assessment of an individual because they can provide a social and cultural context in which to understand an individual's accomplishments and life experience. They allow a candidate's achievements to be viewed through the lens of the culture and community in which they were realized. n47 Arbitrary elimination of race or national origin from the many factors that create the context in which an individual's talent and motivation can be understood would compromise the integrity of the process and would impair the ability of MIT and Stanford to identify the most promising applicants--that is those applicants who would profit most from and contribute most to an MIT or Stanford education. 

n47 Thus, to take a real life example, the design and construction of a solar-powered chili roaster by an applicant to meet the need of his community of migrant farm workers in the Texas panhandle to cook chilis for lunch in the fields, may tell as much about his creative engineering drive and motivation to be of service, as a national science medal does for another applicant. 

Additionally, this individualized assessment of each candidate is guided by critical considerations relating to the universities' missions. First, both MIT and Stanford define their missions broadly to embrace the education of their student bodies and service to the nation, by, as Jane Stanford expressed it, "rendering the greatest possible service to mankind," and, as MIT Founder William Barton Rogers put it, "securing . . . great public benefits." Thus, they train future leaders for work in critical areas, including--primarily, for MIT, and importantly, for Stanford--science and engineering. Neither MIT nor Stanford makes admission decisions to compensate for past wrongs. Instead, they seek diversity in part because in order for these science  [*24]  and technology leaders to develop products and services to improve the lives of people in our diverse world, they must be trained in a heterogeneous environment and be responsive to the needs of each segment of the population. Leaders of science and engineering industry, including DuPont and IBM, confirm what is obvious from the census data--that the global competitiveness of U.S. industry, and the health of the national and world economies, depend on increasing the number of qualified minority engineers and scientists. MIT and Stanford thus believe that in order to most effectively advance their broader educational purposes, it is essential to be cognizant of many of an applicant's personal factors, including race and national origin. 

Second, MIT and Stanford also pay attention to diversity read broadly, in the make-up of the academic community because such diversity provides important educational benefits. Both universities recognize that much learning goes on between and among students, faculty, and administrators, often outside the classroom, and that the learning experience for all students is enhanced by the presence of students offering different cultures, life experiences, and areas of accomplishment. We must not pretend that racial discrimination against minorities is no longer an issue in the United States. Although one's race does not dictate one's views--and this is part of what diversity on campus teaches--race, ethnicity, and national origin do contribute to one's experiences and opportunities in life, adding relevant perspectives. n48

 [*25]  B. Minorities Would Be Even More Under-Represented In The Fields Of Science And Engineering If Race And National Origin Were Not Considered In The Admissions Process 

In the selection process used by MIT and Stanford, which first identifies a group of well-qualified and highly capable applicants and then admits a much smaller number from among them, based on broad evaluation of each individual, consideration of race along with many other factors in making the final decisions is both necessary and entirely appropriate. n49 To require otherwise would both impair their ability to identify the most promising candidates and produce a less diverse educational environment. 

n49 The suggestion of some that the concern for diversity would be better or more justly served by focusing instead on economic diversity, or disadvantage, is unsupportable on two levels. First, economic position does not offer any sort of a useful proxy for race or ethnic origin, and thus does not offer a racially neutral means of achieving the goal of racial or cultural diversity. Simply put, in the population of students from low socio-economic groups who also have high enough test scores to qualify for consideration by highly selective schools, white students outnumber African-American students six-to-one. See SHAPE OF THE RIVER, supra note 9, at 51. Second, the great majority of successful minority candidates come from middle and upper middle class backgrounds. See, e.g., id. at 271. 

Science and engineering are demanding fields that require a significant measure of pre-college preparation in science  [*26]  and mathematics, and an atmosphere that nurtures such professional aspirations. It is a shameful but true fact that minorities tend disproportionately to attend lower quality schools, where both the encouragement and the opportunity to prepare oneself for these areas of study are less accessible. n50 Also, the current, predominantly non-minority make-up of the science and engineering professions means that minorities have few role models and mentors to help guide them to study and pursue careers in these fields. n51 In addition, nationally, African-Americans have a 50% lower likelihood than Caucasians of graduating in the top 10% of their high school class, and have a 40% lower likelihood of having an A average. n52 And, according to the College Board, on the SAT test, minorities not only score on average roughly 10% below the mean of all test takers, n53 but they also constitute a disproportionately small segment of those scoring in the top quartile on those tests. Among all test takers in 2002, scores of 700 or higher were achieved by roughly 5% of those taking the verbal, and 6% of those taking the math portion of the test; for minorities, those  [*27]  respective percentages are around one percent--or fewer than 750 African Americans and 1500 Hispanics nationwide. Scores above 600 were achieved by 21% of those taking the verbal, and 24% of those taking the math; for African Americans the corresponding percentage is just over 5% on both tests, and for Hispanics, it is about 9% on the verbal and almost 10% on the math. n54 For these reasons, the pool of minority students who have high enough scores and grades to be seriously considered on a more individualized basis for admission to selective science and engineering programs is disproportionately small.

n53 For the more than 1.2 million SAT test takers in 2002, the average scores were 505 verbal and 513 math; for the more than 218,000 minorities (including African-Americans and Hispanics) who took the test, the averages were 439 verbal and 440 math.

n54 Id. There is good evidence that the "stereotype effect"--the fear of doing something that would confirm a negative stereotype--is at least one reason for the lower SAT test scores for non-Asian minorities. See Claude M. Steele, A Threat in the Air: How Stereotypes Shape Intellectual Identity and Performance, 52 AM. PSYCHOLOGIST 613, 613-19 (1997); Claude M. Steele & J. Aronson, Stereotype Threat and the Intellectual Test Performance of African Americans, 69 J. OF PERSONALITY & SOCIAL PSYCHOL. 797, 797-811 (1995). 

MIT's and Stanford's ultimate selection of students for admission, from the large group of applicants initially determined to be well qualified and highly capable, is not based only on grades and test scores. If it were, minorities would be even more significantly under-represented than they already are in the fields of science and engineering. n55 And this would be profoundly unfair to the individuals  [*28]  affected and deprive the nation of talented graduates who reflect the diversity of America. n56 

n55 Bowen and Bok report that, regardless of field of study, the overall numbers of black students on campus at highly selective colleges and professional schools would drop to less than 2% of all matriculants under a race-neutral standard, and would decrease further to less than 1% at the most selective schools of law and medicine. See SHAPE OF THE RIVER, supra note 9, at 281, 282. Given the highly selective nature of science and engineering admissions programs and the already low application and participation rates, these paltry numbers would be similar in those fields. See also William G. Bowen & Neil L. Rudenstine, Race-Sensitive Admissions: Back to Basics, THE CHRON. OF HIGHER EDUC., Feb. 7, 2003, at B7 (noting that both public and private universities would become significantly less diverse if they could not take race into account in admissions decisions, in part because every alternative category includes large numbers of competitive non-minorities). 

n56 Some contend that considering race in admissions must mean that a student whose admission was influenced by his or her race was less qualified than others in the pool. But that contention ignores the fact that these institutions make all admissions from the pool of candidates who are first determined to be well-qualified and highly capable. Once the first measure of qualification is met, the meaning of "qualified" expands to include consideration of the many attributes of each individual (such as athletic ability, musical talent, race, and others), in the context of the university's broader goals to train future leaders in an academic setting bringing together varied experiences and backgrounds. 

C. The Use Of Race As One Of Many Factors In The Admissions Process Has Been Successful At Increasing The Diversity In Science And Engineering Academic Programs 

By considering race as one of many factors in the admissions process, n57 MIT has been able to increase minority undergraduate enrollment in a gradual but steady manner--from less than 1% in 1968 to 8% in 1980, 15% in 1990, and 19% in 2000. n58 At Stanford, while diversity in the overall undergraduate student body has increased significantly during this period, undergraduate degrees from the School of Engineering for traditionally underrepresented minorities have increased only slightly. As Glenn C. Loury wrote in his forward to Shape of the River, race-conscious admissions "must continue if the gains are to be maintained, and . . . administrators at selective colleges and universities, acting as  [*29]  just and responsible stewards, can do no less than stay the course." n59 Although progress has been made, the national demographics and limited pool of qualified minority candidates available to MIT and Stanford indicate that more, not less, is needed. 

n57 In addition to their consideration of race as a factor in their admissions processes, MIT and Stanford have undertaken outreach and bridging programs to enhance the prospects of enrolling a diverse group of students able to effectively pursue the demanding science and engineering curricula. These programs have the effect of identifying and expanding the talent-pool of those interested in and capable of pursuing and succeeding in demanding science and engineering undergraduate programs--including under-represented minorities. 

n58 While African Americans comprised less than 1% of MIT's class of 1967-68, see WILLIAMS, supra note 13, at 16, the class of 2001-02 consisted of 6% African Americans.

Moreover, the weight of the evidence and the experience of MIT and Stanford demonstrate that attendance at selective universities provides substantial benefits to all students. n60 Students from selective schools have many opportunities after graduation. n61 Graduation rates for both minority and majority students from MIT and Stanford, and from highly selective schools generally, are very high when compared with national averages and with minority graduation rates at less selective schools. n62 And most science and engineering graduates, including minority graduates, are finding jobs in their fields. n63 It has been the experience of MIT and  [*30]  Stanford, borne out by yield data, that candidates--both minority and non-minority--when given the choice between attending a highly selective school and a less selective one, overwhelmingly choose the more selective alternative.
