Description: A package for the management and quantitative analysis of textual
    data with R. quanteda makes it easy to manage texts in the form of a
    corpus, defined as a collection of texts that includes document-level
    variables specific to each text, as well as meta-data for documents and for
    the collection as a whole. quanteda includes tools to make it easy and fast
    to manuipulate the texts the texts in a corpus, for instance by tokenizing
    them, with or without stopwords or stemming, or to segment them by sentence
    or paragraph units. quanteda implements bootstrapping methods for texts
    that makes it easy to resample texts from pre-defined units, to facilitate
    computation of confidence intervals on textual statistics using techniques
    of non-parametric bootstrapping, but applied to the original texts as data.
    quanteda includes a suite of sophisticated tools to extract features of the
    texts into a quantitative matrix, where these features can be defined
    according to a dictionary or thesaurus, including the declaration of
    collocations to be treated as single features. Once converted into a
    quantitative matrix (known as a ``dfm" for document-feature matrix), the
    textual features can be analyzed using quantitative methods for
    describing, comparing, or scaling texts, or topic modelling, or used to
    train machine learning methods for class prediction.
