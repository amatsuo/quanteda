\section*{The twitter APIs}
Twitter offers two ways for computer programs to post and retrieve data from its service. The twitter REST Search API will receive requests as http commands, and will respond with a JSON object representing a list of tweets. The twitter streaming API allows a computer program to maintain a connection to twitter's service and receive a flow of live public tweets that match the filters or search terms specified.

Both of these APIs require that the developer of the computer program create a twitter account, create a new application, and receive an access token.
